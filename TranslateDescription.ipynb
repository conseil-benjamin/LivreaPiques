Mainstream science--as well as religious and cultural institutions--has maintained that men and women evolved in families in which a man's possessions and protection were exchanged for a woman's fertility and fidelity. But this narrative is collapsing. Fewer and fewer couples are getti Since Darwin's day, we've been told that sexual monogamy comes naturally to our species. Mainstream science--as well as religious and cultural institutions--has maintained that men and women evolved in families in which a man's possessions and protection were exchanged for a woman's fertility and fidelity. But this narrative is collapsing. Fewer and fewer couples are getting married, and divorce rates keep climbing as adultery and flagging libido drag down even seemingly solid marriages. How can reality be reconciled with the accepted narrative? It can't be, according to renegade thinkers Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jethá. While debunking almost everything we \"know\" about sex, they offer a bold alternative explanation in this provocative and brilliant book. Ryan and Jethá's central contention is that human beings evolved in egalitarian groups that shared food, child care, and, often, sexual partners. Weaving together convergent, frequently overlooked evidence from anthropology, archaeology, primatology, anatomy, and psychosexuality, the authors show how far from human nature monogamy really is. Human beings everywhere and in every era have confronted the same familiar, intimate situations in surprisingly different ways. The authors expose the ancient roots of human sexuality while pointing toward a more optimistic future illuminated by our innate capacities for love, cooperation, and generosity. With intelligence, humor, and wonder, Ryan and Jethá show how our promiscuous past haunts our struggles over monogamy, sexual orientation, and family dynamics. They explore why long-term fidelity can be so difficult for so many; why sexual passion tends to fade even as love deepens; why many middle-aged men risk everything for transient affairs with younger women; why homosexuality persists in the face of standard evolutionary logic; and what the human body reveals about the prehistoric origins of modern sexuality. In the tradition of the best historical and scientific writing,   unapologetically upends unwarranted assumptions and unfounded conclusions while offering a revolutionary understanding of why we live and love as we do.\n",

It was also a land withered by drought and hunger, and a place where hope and opportunity were hard to find. But William had read about windmills in a book called Using Energy, and he dreamed of building one that would bring electricity and water to his village and change his life and the lives of those around him. His neighbors may have mocked him and called him misala—crazy—but William was determined to show them what a little grit and ingenuity could do. Enchanted by the workings of electricity as a boy, William had a goal to study science in Malawi's top boarding schools. But in 2002, his country was stricken with a famine that left his family's farm devastated and his parents destitute. Unable to pay the eighty-dollar-a-year tuition for his education, William was forced to drop out and help his family forage for food as thousands across the country starved and died. Yet William refused to let go of his dreams. With nothing more than a fistful of cornmeal in his stomach, a small pile of once-forgotten science textbooks, and an armory of curiosity and determination, he embarked on a daring plan to bring his family a set of luxuries that only two percent of Malawians could afford and what the West considers a necessity—electricity and running water. Using scrap metal, tractor parts, and bicycle halves, William forged a crude yet operable windmill, an unlikely contraption and small miracle that eventually powered four lights, complete with homemade switches and a circuit breaker made from nails and wire. A second machine turned a water pump that could battle the drought and famine that loomed with every season. Soon, news of William's  —his \"electric wind\"—spread beyond the borders of his home, and the boy who was once called crazy became an inspiration to those around the world.

This passionate, often surprising, intimate record, kept under lock and key for some forty years in Mexico, reveals many new dimensions in the complex persona of this remarkable Mexican artist. Covering the years 1944-45, the 170-page journal contains Frida's thoughts, poems, and dreams, and reflects her stormy relationship with her husband, Diego Rivera, Mexico's famous artist. The seventy watercolor illustrations in the journal - some lively sketches, several elegant self-portraits, others complete paintings - offer insights into her creative process, and show her frequently using the journal to work out pictorial ideas for her canvases. The text entries, written in Frida's round, full script in brightly colored inks, add an almost decorative quality, making the journal as captivating to look at as it is to read. Frida's childhood, her political sensibilities, and her obsession with Diego are all illuminated in witty phrases and haunting images. Although much has been written recently about this extraordinary woman, Frida Kahlo's art and life continue to fascinate the world. This personal document, published in a complete full-color facsimile edition, will add greatly to the understanding of her unique and powerful vision and her enormous courage in the face of more than thirty-five operations to correct injuries she had sustained in an accident at the age of eighteen. The facsimile is accompanied by an introduction by the world-renowned Mexican man of letters Carlos Fuentes and a complete translation of the diary's text. An essay on the place of the diary in Frida's work and in art history at large, as well as commentaries on the images, is provided by Sarah M. Lowe.\n",

His twenty-three international bestsellers have ranged from the beloved Shannara series to stories that tread a much darker path. Armageddon's Children is a new creation–the perfect opportunity for readers unfamiliar with Brooks's previous work to experience an author at the height of his considerable storytelling powers. It is a gripping chronicle of a once-familiar world now spun shockingly out of control, in which an extraordinary few struggle to salvage hope in the face of terrifying chaos.  Logan Tom is doomed to remember the past and determined to rescue the future. Far behind him lies a boyhood cut violently short by his family's slaughter, when the forces of madness and hate swept our world after decadent excesses led to civilization's downfall. Somewhere ahead of him rests the only chance to beat back the minions of evil that are systematically killing and enslaving the last remnants of humanity. Navigating the scarred and poisoned landscape that once was America and guided by a powerful talisman, Logan has sworn an oath to seek out a remarkable being born of magic, possessed of untold abilities, and destined to lead the final fight against darkness. Across the country, Angel Perez, herself a survivor of the malevolent, death-dealing forces combing the land, has also been chosen for an uncanny mission in the name of her ruined world's salvation. From the devastated streets of Los Angeles, she will journey to find a place–and a people–shrouded in mystery, celebrated in legend, and vital to the cause of humankind . . . even as a relentless foe follows close behind, bent on her extermination. While in the nearly forsaken city of Seattle, a makeshift family of refugees has carved out a tenuous existence among the street gangs, mutants, and marauders fighting to stay alive against mounting odds–and something unspeakable that has come from the shadows in search of prey.  In time, all their paths will cross. Their common purpose will draw them together. Their courage and convictions will be tested and their fates will be decided, as their singular crusade begins: to take back, or lose forever, the only world they have. In Armageddon's Children, Brooks brings his gifts as a mythmaker to the timeless theme of the unending, essential conflict between darkness and light–and carries his unique imaginative vision to a stunning new level. Prepare for a breathtaking tour de force. To those who are new to Terry Brooks, welcome. And to those who have read him for many years: prepare for a dramatic surprise.\n",

Retired Marine Master Sergeant Adam Montague has battled through four com Have you ever fallen in love with the wrong person—or the person who feels he or she is wrong for you?  BOOK DESCRIPTION:  NOBODY'S HERO is the continuing romantic journey of Adam and Karla, which began in MASTERS AT ARMS & NOBODY'S ANGEL.  Retired Marine Master Sergeant Adam Montague has battled through four combat zones, but now finds himself retreating from Karla Paxton, who has declared war on his heart. With a significant age difference, he feels he should be her guardian and protector, not her lover. But Karla's knack for turning up in his bed at inopportune times is killing his resolve to do the right thing. Karla isn't the young girl he rescued nine years earlier—something his body reminds him of every chance it gets.  Their age difference is only part of the problem. Fifty-year-old Adam has been a collector of lost and vulnerable souls most of his life, but a secret he has run from for more than three decades has kept him emotionally unable to admit love for anyone. Will Karla be able to break through the defenses around his heart and help him put the ghosts from his past to rest? In her all-out war to get Adam to surrender his heart, will the strong-willed Goth singer offer herself as his submissive and, if so, at what cost to herself?  ABOUT THE RESCUE ME SAGA: The books in the ongoing Rescue Me Saga are not stand-alone stories and should be read in order. Characters will recur in later books to deal with further issues in their lives as the saga continues and each book builds upon all previous ones.

And like the tumultuous meeting of the cataract's waters with the rocks below, a chance encounter between Tom and 17-year-old Bess Heath has an explosive effect. When they first meet on a trolley p Tom Cole, the grandson of a legendary local hero, has inherited an uncanny knack for reading the Niagara River's whims and performing daring feats of rescue at the mighty falls. And like the tumultuous meeting of the cataract's waters with the rocks below, a chance encounter between Tom and 17-year-old Bess Heath has an explosive effect. When they first meet on a trolley platform, Bess immediately recognizes the chemistry between them, and the feeling is mutual.  But the hopes of young love are constrained by the 1915 conventions of Niagara Falls, Ontario. Tom's working-class pedigree doesn't suit Bess's family, despite their recent fall from grace. Sacked from his position at a hydroelectric power company, Bess's father has taken to drink, forcing her mother to take in sewing for the society women who were once her peers. Bess pitches in as she pines for Tom, but at her young age, she's unable to fully realize how drastically her world is about to change.  Set against the resounding backdrop of the falls, Cathy Marie Buchanan's carefully researched, capaciously imagined debut novel entwines the romantic trials of a young couple with the historical drama of the exploitation of the river's natural resources. The current of the river, like that of the human heart, is under threat: \"Sometimes it seems like the river is being made into this measly thing,\" says Tom, bemoaning the shortsighted schemes of the power companies. \"The river's been bound up with cables and concrete and steel, like a turkey at Christmastime.\"  Skillfully portraying individuals, families, a community, and an environment imperiled by progress and the devastations of the Great War,   beautifully evokes the wild wonder of its setting, a wonder that always overcomes any attempt to tame it. But at the same time, Buchanan's tale never loses hold of the gripping emotions of Tom and Bess's intimate drama. The result is a transporting novel that captures both the majesty of nature and the mystery of love. Also, download the free study guide:  .\n",

Flight Behavior transfixes from its opening scene, when a young woman's narrow experience of life is thrown wide with the force of a raging fire. In the lyrical language of her native Appalachia, Barbara Kingsolver bares the rich, tarnished humanity of her novel's inhabitants and unearths the modern complexities of rural existence. Characters and reader alike are quickly carried beyond familiar territory here, into the unsettled ground of science, faith, and everyday truces between reason and conviction.  Dellarobia Turnbow is a restless farm wife who gave up her own plans when she accidentally became pregnant at seventeen. Now, after a decade of domestic disharmony on a failing farm, she has settled for permanent disappointment but seeks momentary escape through an obsessive flirtation with a younger man. As she hikes up a mountain road behind her house to a secret tryst, she encounters a shocking sight: a silent, forested valley filled with what looks like a lake of fire. She can only understand it as a cautionary miracle, but it sparks a raft of other explanations from scientists, religious leaders, and the media. The bewildering emergency draws rural farmers into unexpected acquaintance with urbane journalists, opportunists, sightseers, and a striking biologist with his own stake in the outcome. As the community lines up to judge the woman and her miracle, Dellarobia confronts her family, her church, her town, and a larger world, in a flight toward truth that could undo all she has ever believed.

Through it, Balzac paints a portrait of a decadent aristocracy: heirs to their father's suspicious illness, his children are condemned to a feverish life, while she sacrifices her happiness to them. Félix has never known either maternal love or that of women: attracted by the constraints that weigh on the body and life of this mother, he opens himself to a strange and morbid eroticism. Félix and Henriette, these two suffering beings, unite to oppose the violence of the world with the refuge of an impossible love. Sometimes compared to the Princess of Clèves, because of her refusal to give herself to the one she loves, Henriette de Mortsauf truly constitutes its monstrous reverse. Chastity does not always rhyme with virtue: while Félix exhausts his ardor in stealing this oppressed voluptuousness, the young man is prey to the rapacious desire that feeds illness for health, death for life. Chasing the haunting scent of the lily, Balzac flushes out desire in this valley that one can only cross at the cost of a fever of love and agony.\n",

When Olive Wellwood's oldest son discovers a runaway named Philip sketching in the basement of the new Victoria and Albert Museum—a talented working-class boy who could be a character out of one of Olive's magical tales—she takes him into the storybook world of her family and friends. But the joyful bacchanals Olive hosts at her rambling country house—and the separate, private books she writes for each of her seven children—conceal more treachery and darkness than Philip has ever imagined. As these lives—of adults and children alike—unfold, lies are revealed, hearts are broken, and the damaging truth about the Wellwoods slowly emerges.

      "Karigan G'ladheon is a Green Rider--a seasoned member of the elite messenger corps of King Zachary of Sacoridia. This corps of messengers, each gifted with a brooch of office that imparts a unique magical ability to its wearer, was founded over a thousand years ago during the terrible time of the Long War. During that spell-fueled war, Sacoridia was besieged by the sorcerou Karigan G'ladheon is a Green Rider--a seasoned member of the elite messenger corps of King Zachary of Sacoridia. This corps of messengers, each gifted with a brooch of office that imparts a unique magical ability to its wearer, was founded over a thousand years ago during the terrible time of the Long War. During that spell-fueled war, Sacoridia was besieged by the sorcerous armies of the Arcosian Empire, led by Mornhavon the Black. When Sacoridia finally triumphed, Mornhavon resorted to dark magic that rendered his twisted spirit immortal. Determined to keep the realm safe from this terrifying enemy, multitudes of Sacoridian magicians sacrificed their lives to build the immense D'Yer Wall, imprisoning the dangerous spirit of Mornhavon in Blackveil Forest, which uncontrolled magic had mutated into a perilous and unnatural place. For over a thousand years, the magic of the D'Yer Wall protected the people of Sacoridia, but as the centuries passed, memory of how the wall had been built was lost as a traumatized nation turned its back on magic. And when a malicious entity cracked the massive wall, there were none left who knew how to repair it. Desperate to regain the knowledge and repair the ever-expanding breach in the wall, agents of the king scoured the kingdom for magical relics and information. Finally, in a last-ditch attempt to gain time, Karigan, whose Rider brooch enabled her to \"fade\"--sometimes traversing the layers of time and space--was able to catapult the spirit of Mornhavon into the future. But how far into the future was anyone's guess. Realizing that this might be their only chance to enter Blackveil and examine the tainted peninsula, King Zachary sends Karigan and a contingent of Sacoridians beyond the wall, along with an equal number of Eletians--the immortal race that eons ago lived in what is now Blackveil Forest. But in addition to the unnatural dangers of the forest itself, Karigan and her small delegation have been followed by a secret rebel sect--descendants of the original Arcosian invaders, and during a showdown between these two groups, Mornhavon suddenly reappears. In the magical confrontation that follows, Karigan is jolted out of Blackveil and wakes in a darkness blacker than night. She's lying on smooth, cold stone, but as she reaches out, she realizes that the stone is not just beneath her, but above and around her as well. She's landed in a sealed stone sarcophagus, some unknown tomb, and the air is becoming thin. Is this to be her end? If she escapes, where will she find herself? Is she still in the world she remembers, or has the magical explosion transported her somewhere completely different? To find out, she must first win free of her prison--before it becomes her grave. And should she succeed, will she be walking straight into a trap created by Mornhavon himself?\n",

As Scarpetta watches she comes to grips with frightening secrets about her niece, whom she loves like a daughter. That first clip and others sent soon after raise dangerous implications that increasingly isolate Scarpetta and leave her confused, alarmed, and not knowing where to turn. She doesn't know whom she can tell – not her FBI agent husband, Benton Wesley, or her investigative partner, Pete Marino. Not even Lucy. Cornwell launches these unforgettable characters on an intensely psychological odyssey that includes the bizarre death of a Hollywood mogul's daughter, wreckage on the bottom of the sea in the Bermuda Triangle, a grisly gift left in the back of a crime scene truck, and videos from the past that threaten to destroy Scarpetta's entire world and everyone she loves. The diabolical presence and singularly \"depraved heart\" behind what unfolds seems obvious - but strangely, not to the FBI. Certainly that's the message they send when they start harassing Lucy and begin building a case that could send her to prison for the rest of her life. In the latest novel in her bestselling series featuring medical examiner Dr. Kay Scarpetta, Cornwell captivates readers again with the jolting twists, high-wire tension, and cutting-edge forensic detail for which she is renowned, proving yet again why she is the world's number one bestselling crime writer.\n",

But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it's up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth.\n",

He was, of course, speaking for his own generation, and a hundred years later the opinion may seem somewhat exaggerated. However, there is no doubt that   is a superb novel of its kind, and it is still as readable and enjoyable as ever H.G. Wells described The Old Wives' Tale as \"by far the finest long novel written in English and in the English fashion\". He was, of course, speaking for his own generation, and a hundred years later the opinion may seem somewhat exaggerated. However, there is no doubt that   is a superb novel of its kind, and it is still as readable and enjoyable as ever. First published in 1908, it tells the story of the Baines sisters--shy, retiring Constance and defiant, romantic Sophia--over the course of nearly half a century. Bennett traces the lives of the sisters from childhood in their father's drapery shop in provincial Bursley, England, during the mid-Victorian era, through their married lives, to the modern industrial age, when they are reunited as old women. The setting moves from the Five Towns of the Staffordshire Potteries to exotic and cosmopolitan Paris. It was fascinating to learn from Bennett's journal how he saw an old lady in a cafe and was inspired to think of how her life might have been lived, how she must have once been young. The plot of the novel came to him fairly promptly, and, as they say, the rest is history. This novel was serialized on British television with great success circa 2000.\n",

Tintin decides to let the matter drop but then, while flying over Syldavia, it is the pilot of the plane who opens a trap door and Tintin drops out, landing in a haywagon. Tintin has a hunch that a plot is afoot to steal the sceptre of King Ottokar IV. In Syldavia, the reigning King must possess the sceptre to rule or he will be forced to abdicate. Every year he rides in a parade during St. Vladimir's Day carrying it, while the people sing the national anthem. Tintin succeeds in warning the reigning King, Muskar XII, despite the efforts of the conspirators. He and the King rush to the royal treasure room to find Alembick, the royal photographer and some guards unconscious and the sceptre missing. Tintin's friends Thomson and Thompson are summoned to investigate but their theory on how the sceptre was stolen proves bad and painful for them. Later on, Tintin notices a spring cannon in a toy shop and this gives him the clue. Professor Alembick had asked for some photographs to be taken of the sceptre, but the camera was a spring cannon in disguise, which allowed him to catapult it out of the castle into a nearby forest. Searching the forest, Tintin spots the sceptre being found by agents of the neighbouring country, Borduria. Following them all the way to the border, he wrests the sceptre from them. In the wallet of one of the thieves he discovers papers that show that the theft of the sceptre was just part of a major plan for the taking over of Syldavia by their long-time political rival, Borduria. Tintin steals a Me-109 from a Bordurian airfield (whose squadron is being kept ready to take part in the envisioned \"Anschluss\" of Syldavia) to fly it back to the King in time. He is shot down by the Syldavians who have naturally opened fire on an enemy aircraft violating their airspace. He manages to make the rest of the journey by foot. Meanwhile the Interior Minister informs the King that rumours have been spreading that the sceptre has been stolen and that there have been riots against local Bordurian businesses, acts which would justify a Bordurian takeover of the country. The King is about to abdicate when Snowy runs in with the sceptre (which had fallen out of Tintin's pocket). Tintin then gives the King the papers he took from the man who stole the sceptre. They prove that the plot was masterminded by Müsstler, leader of the Iron Guard, a local political party. The King takes action by having Müsstler and his associates arrested and the army mobilised along the Bordurian frontier. In response, the Bordurian leader pulls his own troops back from the border, though he stresses his own country's \"desire for peace\" and criticises Syldavia's \"strange\" behaviour. The next day is St. Vladimir's Day and Tintin is made a Knight of the Order of the Golden Pelican, the first non-Syldavian to receive such an honour. Further inquiries by the authorities reveal that, in a classic Ruritanian plot device, Professor Alembick is one of a pair of identical twins: Hector Alembick was kidnapped and replaced with his brother Alfred who left for Syldavia in his place. Tintin and Snowy return home by a flying boat with Thomson and Thompson, who suffer momentary panic when the aircraft appears to be falling into the sea at the end of the flight. The reader is treated to a rare \"wink to the camera\" from Tintin, who points out their error, and they laugh about it so much that they do indeed fall into the sea as they disembark.\n",

Veteran   reporter Michael Dobbs has pored over previously untapped American, Soviet, and Cuban sources to produce the most authoritative book yet on the Cuban missile crisis. In his hour-by-hour chronicle of those near-fatal days, Dobbs reveals some startling new incidents that illustrate how close we really did come to Armageddon.  Here, for the first time, are gripping accounts of Khrushchev's plan to destroy the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo; the accidental overflight of the Soviet Union by an American spy plane; the movement of Soviet nuclear warheads around Cuba during the tensest days of the crisis; the activities of CIA agents inside Cuba; and the crash landing of an American F-106 jet with a live nuclear weapon on board.  Dobbs takes us inside the White House and the Kremlin as Kennedy and Khrushchev--rational, intelligent men separated by an ocean of ideological suspicion--agonize over the possibility of war. He shows how these two leaders recognized the terrifying realities of the nuclear age while Castro--never swayed by conventional political considerations--demonstrated the messianic ambition of a man selected by history for a unique mission. As the story unfolds, Dobbs brings us onto the decks of American ships patrolling Cuba; inside sweltering Soviet submarines and missile units as they ready their warheads; and onto the streets of Miami, where anti-Castro exiles plot the dictator's overthrow.  Based on exhaustive new research and told in breathtaking prose, here is ariveting account of history's most dangerous hours, full of lessons for our time.\n",

Karys Kitane is not like other girls her age.

Upon eating the scarlet sprout she discovers Dream and Darkness, which she swallows whole and splits wide open. Now, she sees the world differently and it does not matter so much that she is invisible to her parents or that her schoolmates are terrific wretches because she has courage, wanderlust, and curiosity in spades. Beckoned by her great aunt to the furthest hillsides of the Caribbean where she lives, she will embark on an enchanted, unforgettable adventure of mystic mayhem and explore a cave that has deeper secrets than she-or anyone-could ever imagine.\n",

      "Alexandria, 3rd century. The splendours of Egypt have faded and the country has become a grey province of a decaying Roman Empire. The times are changing: Christianity is the official religion, but it has not caught on with the people; the old gods refuse to die and magic and science, administration and sacred worship coexist in the narrow streets of Alexandria, 3rd century. The splendours of Egypt have faded and the country has become a grey province of a decaying Roman Empire. The times are changing: Christianity is the official religion, but it has not caught on with the people; the old gods refuse to die and magic and science, administration and sacred worship coexist in the narrow streets of the megalopolis that spreads out beneath the famous lighthouse. Unaware of the changes and the decline, unaware of the barbarian invasions that are crumbling the borders of the Western Empire, life at court and in the palaces is polarized by the two great human passions: love and power. This is the magnificent setting where the particular destiny of three characters is played out: Ahram, a powerful navigator, emblem of courage and masculine strength; Krito, an androgynous philosopher, symbol of rationality and consistency of character; and an elusive and sensual woman who has the ability to change her name. A woman who will enter Ahram's life when Anoptis, the great steward of the village of Tanuris, buys her for his lord at the slave market. Ahram suddenly falls in love with the girl, who says her name is Irenia, and between them begins an intense love story full of sensuality. But, as Krito soon realises, there are mysterious circumstances lurking behind Irenia, more enigmatic than her rescue on the coast by coral fishermen, even more so than her initiation into a group of religious women who believe in the feminine nature of Jesus: a fantastic and almost blasphemous transformation that could take the love story with Ahram beyond death or destroy it before its time.\n",

It's evil versus evil when Renzo, a proud immortal, who wonders if there still is some shred of human emotion inside of him, faces an ancient evil force, who seems to be as powerful as he is, with the perfect bait; the secret of how to turn immortals back into mortals in exchange for Renzo's soul.  \"Immortality Get ready for the ultimate showdown between fangs and pure evil! It's evil versus evil when Renzo, a proud immortal, who wonders if there still is some shred of human emotion inside of him, faces an ancient evil force, who seems to be as powerful as he is, with the perfect bait; the secret of how to turn immortals back into mortals in exchange for Renzo's soul.  \"Immortality is not easy\" - says Renzo, a vampire, several times in the book more as a warning than an explanation. The fact of conquering death must have a powerful effect inside anyone's mind. How an immortal of any kind could believe in any type of deities, beliefs, myths or any other human concept regarding the afterlife? In the same way, how come someone who defies all laws of nature and those of physics can validate an improbability like that \"it\" we call soul? That's the core of \"Eternal Darkness, Blood King.\"  From the beginning the story sounds familiar; the vampire with a story to tell, but all similarities end when the plot quickly transforms into something deeper with an array of fascinating characters; like Frank Lopez, a seventy year old alcoholic, cannibal and psychic whose mental power only increases by the consumption of human flesh; specially if it comes from children. Also, Jason Drake and Julia Saravova; Renzo's loyal protégés and eternal twenty something vampires with a taste for violence. Maximilian Hunter; an ex-USMC captain on a man-hunt trying to stop Renzo without fully realizing what he's getting himself into. The young Lucy Buren; a gifted artists and Renzo's business associate who knows the truth about Renzo but refuses to walk away from their friendship. Erika Foster; a tragic teenager with a mysterious past and on a mission. Jean Charles Reneu and Amy Harlow; a pair of millionaire \"collectors\" obsessed with capturing Renzo and unlock the mystery of his immortality, and a tactical unit of mercenaries trying to destroy \"the most dangerous of all creatures\" are the elements of this vampire epic tale.  When Renzo decides to accept to trade his soul he asks;\"who cares to whom my inexistent soul belongs to when I will go on living forever?\" The answer to his question will take the reader to a surprising journey beyond faith, the mysteries of immortality and time itself.  \"Eternal Darkness, Blood King\" is a true feast for all vampire lovers, and a new take on the immortal lore with unexpected twists and turns that will leave the reader asking for more.\n",

One of the most extraordinary survival stories ever told -- Aron Ralston's searing account of his six days trapped in one of the most remote spots in America, and how one inspired act of bravery brought him home.  It started out as a simple hike in the Utah canyonlands on a warm Saturday afternoon. For Aron Ralston, a twenty-seven-year-old mountaineer and outdoorsman, a walk into the remote Blue John Canyon was a chance to get a break from a winter of solo climbing Colorado's highest and toughest peaks. He'd earned this weekend vacation, and though he met two charming women along the way, by early afternoon he finally found himself in his element: alone, with just the beauty of the natural world all around him.  It was 2:41 P.M. Eight miles from his truck, in a deep and narrow slot canyon, Aron was climbing down off a wedged boulder when the rock suddenly, and terrifyingly, came loose. Before he could get out of the way, the falling stone pinned his right hand and wrist against the canyon wall.  And so began six days of hell for Aron Ralston. With scant water and little food, no jacket for the painfully cold nights, and the terrible knowledge that he'd told no one where he was headed, he found himself facing a lingering death -- trapped by an 800-pound boulder 100 feet down in the bottom of a canyon. As he eliminated his escape options one by one through the days, Aron faced the full horror of his predicament: By the time any possible search and rescue effort would begin, he'd most probably have died of dehydration, if a flash flood didn't drown him before that.  What does one do in the face of almost certain death? Using the video camera from his pack, Aron began recording his grateful good-byes to his family and friends all over the country, thinking back over a life filled with adventure, and documenting a last will and testament with the hope that someone would find it. (For their part, his family and friends had instigated a major search for Aron, the amazing details of which are also documented here for the first time.) The knowledge of their love kept Aron Ralston alive, until a divine inspiration on Thursday morning solved the riddle of the boulder. Aron then committed the most extreme act imaginable to save himself.  Between a Rock and a Hard Place -- a brilliantly written, funny, honest, inspiring, and downright astonishing report from the line where death meets life -- will surely take its place in the annals of classic adventure stories.\n",

The heroes of this novel are a strange mix of socially, culturally and materially diverse characters, carefully chosen by the author who delved into the depths of each one of them.

Most of them meet in a famous bar on the Nile in the same ancient neighborhood, where Ashraf El Ashmawy takes us on a journey into a strange world with its amazingly precise details, using a smooth aesthetic language and a wonderful narrative style to present human tragedies that break hearts and end with even stranger endings. It may seem fair at first glance in appearance, but it will shock you greatly when you get to know its true essence, for absolute justice is only in heaven. Inside the bar, you will get to know a hidden side of the lives of politicians and influential people... corrupt officers, former ministers, and semi-famous people... and lost, carefree youth, fallen women, and other lost people, and upper classes of society who have recently surfaced. The author sheds light on them so that you can see with him the lives of bats and what happens in the corridors of bars and how the bartender is the center of their lives and knows their secrets, so he becomes their drinking companion. You will read between the lines of this novel how we give each other a drink mixed with bright promises and present false feelings until the alcohol plays with our heads and the symptoms of false ecstasy appear until the decisive moment comes when everyone wakes up, bartenders and drinkers, and discovers the truth devoid of all falsehood, like sleepwalkers who go on their way and never know that they will wake up at a moment determined by fate alone, and they always realize it too late.\n",

      "The folk joke that God, who had finished man in the process of creating the world, looked at him for a moment and thought: \"I can do better.\" And made a woman.  A strong woman is the most beautiful masterpiece of divine creation. But how to live your life in such a way that the divine light in a woman does not dry up, that the shine does not fade with the years, but the power increases with age? In order for this power to become that, Rahvasuu jokes that God, who had prepared a man in the process of creating the world, looked at him for a moment and thought: \"I can do better.\" And made a woman.  A strong woman is the most beautiful masterpiece of divine creation. But how to live your life in such a way that the divine light in a woman does not dry up, that the shine does not fade with the years, but the power increases with age? That this power can feed self-esteem, which is the basis of all relationships? This kind of life is art.  The undercurrents of a woman's deep world, which guide her thinking, feelings and behavior, can be called woman's archetypes.  Healthy archetypes make a woman strong, shadow archetypes reduce her to fertilizer. The archetypes - Girl child, Lover, Mistress and Queen - manifest in different aspects of a woman's life. A girl child brings emotionality, joy of life, play and mobility, dance and sports into a woman's life. With the help of the Sensual Lover, the woman enters into physical contact with the man. In a woman's life, the hostess takes care of her family relationships, housekeeping, cleanliness and maintaining her own inner world. The queen is evident in her relations with the outside world, in knowing her worth and in expressing her views clearly and boldly.  Every woman has a palette of archetypes at birth, it's like the code of her Primordial Woman, which should ensure a full-blooded life. Unfortunately, it often happens in the course of life that a woman deviates from healthy archetypes to false archetypes. He has either too little or, on the contrary, too much energy of the healthy archetype.  What are the reasons why a woman loses touch with powerful archetypes? What archetypes do men look for in relationships with women? What archetypes does a woman need for a successful relationship? Which shadow archetypes are guaranteed to bring you stuck in negative emotions?  \"The Art of Being a Woman\" takes the reader to the angels and demons—archetypes and sub-archetypes—of the female psyche. In the hope that through the awareness of the dark sides and the expression of healthy archetypes, a woman can examine herself from a new point of view and change her life for a better artistic result. The deep psychological content of the book is presented in an exceptionally simple and clear way, and it is an exciting piece of reading even for those who bypass academic psychology with a long arc. Katrin Saali Saul is an excellent storyteller, her lush language and unparalleled images reveal the secrets of a woman's soul deeper than anyone has ever been able to do before. There is something for everyone here. This is a great handbook for women who are currently at odds with themselves or in need of some guidance on how to resolve their relationships, to the delight of those who are doing well in life but need some spice and color. An irreplaceable guide for men who want to get to know their enigmatic Muse better. Marina Paula Eberth, Master of Psychology, head of the Holistic Institute\n",

      "Dar Al Shorouk has issued a new edition of the enjoyable biography of the great thinker Dr. Abdel Wahab El Messiri. It monitors his individual transformations in thought and methodology and, at the same time, chronicles an entire generation, or a sector of it. The transformations of the author of this biography are in no way unrelated to what was happening around him. From this perspective, the events of the author's life become unimportant in and of themselves, but rather their importance lies in the extent to which they shed light on his intellectual development. Dar Al Shorouk has issued a new edition of the enjoyable biography of the great thinker Dr. Abdel Wahab El Messiri. It monitors his individual transformations in thought and methodology and, at the same time, chronicles an entire generation, or a sector of it. The transformations of the author of this biography are in no way unrelated to what was happening around him. From this perspective, the events of the author's life become unimportant in and of themselves, but rather their importance lies in the extent to which they shed light on his intellectual development. The author understood many of the events of his personal (subjective) life through the same underlying basic themes and analytical categories that he used in his (objective) studies and research, and not the other way around. However, this intellectual journey is the author's individual journey, as he interacted with the experiences around him since he was born and raised in Damanhour until he moved to Alexandria, then to New York, and finally to Cairo, where he settled. If this intellectual journey is a non-autobiographical biography, it is also a non-objective biography, the biography of a person who meets the public in his private life space, and for this reason he does not only mention abstract intellectual issues, but always supports them with events from his life or quotes from his writings that show how the intellectual (public) issue itself was translated into specific events and facts in his personal (private) life, in the author's smooth, profound, and sarcastic style. This new edition is distinguished by some additions, the most important of which is a large photo appendix that deals with the author's journey and the various stations of his life.\n",

Tragedy strikes in a remote city called El-Versium which becomes the war zone between the Damiroo colony's military and their project gone wrong, Lunar-Mount—a threat detecting droid that destroys any potential source of danger with the highest threat levels relative to any around it.

The FTP source coding stream was wiped out from the robot's programming so the trio has to dive right into the robot's system via Neuro-Surge injection: a technology designed by both Damien and Bruce which allows for the human subconscious to be plugged right into the heart of any computer systems which generates computer functionality in a real world representation. The trio must dive into the system and program the kill switch directly into the robot's system. Little do they know that this is yet just an cover-up operation to use the trio to further the military's project-QR; resurfacing a long since sunken city from before the times of the war which allegedly harbored civilization's largest King Solomon's Library and the T-16 weapons vault. The race is on!\n",

      "The action of Jacek Dukaj's latest novel takes place in an alternative reality, where World War I never broke out, it is 1924, and the Kingdom of Poland is still frozen under the rule of the Tsar and in the Belle Epoque. Warsaw is frozen – in the middle of summer, snowstorms cover the roads. Lute, unearthly angels of Frost, walk the streets of cities, freezing truth and falsehood… Benedykt Gie The action of Jacek Dukaj's latest novel takes place in an alternative reality, where World War I never broke out, it is 1924, and the Kingdom of Poland is still frozen under the rule of the Tsar and in the Belle Epoque. Warsaw is frozen – in the middle of summer, snowstorms cover the roads. Lute, unearthly angels of Frost, walk the streets of cities, freezing truth and falsehood... Benedykt Gierosławski, a gifted mathematician but also an incorrigible gambler, is sent on the Trans-Siberian Express to the frozen city of Irkutsk by order of the Tsar's Ministry of Winter, from where he is to set off in search of his father, who is said to be able to communicate with the angels of frost - lute. A thousand rubles in cash would get Benedykt out of debt, but isn't the mission perhaps too dangerous? It quickly turns out that for Benedykt this will be a journey that will change his life... The plot of Ice is full of breathtaking plot twists, political, love, criminal and economic, scientific and metaphysical intrigues; filled with fascinating characters, with the action stretched between the dirty outbuildings of tsarist Warsaw, the luxury of the Trans-Siberian Express against the backdrop of icy Asia, the Irkutsk salons of the wealthy Polish bourgeoisie, and the sky-high palace of the governor-general - it is a novel that all lovers of true adventure have been waiting for, intelligent, stimulating the intellect and imagination, changing our view of reality. This is a story about History, or about that which does not exist. This is another literary masterpiece by Jacek Dukaj, thanks to which readers will be able to get to know not only the fascinating, blood-curdling \"other possible\" history of the world, but will also have the opportunity to take an extraordinary journey on the Trans-Siberian Express with the hero of the novel and stand face to face with the Other.\n",

      "A monumental Tolstoyesque family epic spanning six generations from 1900 to the present. Eight lives of one Georgian family, beginning in a small town between Georgia and Azerbaijan, where a talented chocolatier raises his daughters and in passing invents a recipe for a delicious chocolate drink with dangerous powers. It brings him wealth and prestige, but at that time it also soon means danger. Niza is the great-granddaughter of Stasia, one of the chocolatier's daughters. She lives in Berlin and tells in a compelling way, but also with a lot of irony and humour, the dramatic history of her family and that of the 'red' twentieth century - a crucial period in European history - with the rise and fall of the Soviet Union, the fall of the Iron Curtain and perestroika.\n",

Van 1885 tot 1908 werd het land bestierd door koning Leopold ii, die een fortuin verdiende met de exploitatie van rubber.

      "At the beginning of the twenty-first century, there is hardly a more turbulent nation than Congo, the gigantic country in the heart of Africa, bursting with the raw materials that are indispensable in our modern age – and with horrific conflicts. How could the former, relatively peaceful colony of Belgium, independent since 1960, change so much? David Van Reybrouck describes for the first time the astonishing history of Congo, from well before the arrival of the explorer Stanley up to and including the influence of China in the last ten years and the recent economic crisis. From 1885 to 1908, the country was ruled by King Leopold II, who made a fortune from rubber exploitation. The colonization by Belgium in the period from 1908 to 1960 provided industrialization and infrastructure, but was also characterized by paternalism, if not patronizing. The sudden transition from colony to independent state around 1960 is a breathtaking story full of idealism and scheming. The new country plunged into a turbulent adventure that became increasingly wild and chaotic and, after thirty-two years of dictatorship under Mobutu, led to one of the deadliest conflicts since the Second World War. Van Reybrouck bases his work not only on rare archive material and groundbreaking research, but above all on hundreds of conversations he had with Congolese. His eyewitnesses range from centenarians to child soldiers, from rebel leaders to smugglers, from ministers to cassava sellers. The author has integrated their stories into his great history.\n",

In the middle, meanwhile, are The Great Switcheroo and The Last Act, two stories exploring a darker side of desire and pleasure. In the black comedies of Switch Bitch Roald Dahl brilliantly captures the ins and outs, highs and lows of sex. 'Dahl is too good a storyteller to become predictable' Daily Telegraph Roald Dahl, the brilliant and worldwide acclaimed author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, Matilda, and many more classics for children, also wrote scores of short stories for adults. These delightfully disturbing tales have often been filmed and were most recently the inspiration for the West End play, Roald Dahl's Twisted Tales by Jeremy Dyson. Roald Dahl's stories continue to make readers shiver today.\n",

Wall Street speculators, the Manhattan downtown club scene, Russian gangsters, immigrant neighborhoods - all the elements in the urban turf of this finely crafted contemporary crime novel wed danger with excitement and possibility. They're the rewards that Monty Brogan, who stands at the center of the moral glare in this tale, has already lost, just as he's lost his Corvette, and the \"sway\" that opened the doors of exclusive night spots and guaranteed him courtside seats at Madison Square Garden. Tomorrow Monty's traveling by bus, to the federal prison in Otisville, for seven years. He's afraid, and all he'd ever really wanted when he grew up was to be a fireman. With the pulse of the city in its prose, this debut novel follows Monty through the twenty-four hours of his last day out. At the same time, it illuminates the worlds, and souls, of his two best friends: Frank Slattery, an edgy bond trader who gambles daily with financial ruin, and Jakob Elinsky, an English teacher who clings to illusions as he compromises his ideals. Friends since their high school days, the three of them nostalgically share a past, but warily they confront a future that can no longer accommodate their adolescent dreams. They meet. They drink, and talk, go clubbing, dance, drink, and remember. What neither Slattery nor Jakob know, however, is that Monty has a plan. It's a shocker.

Every aircraft is equipped with an almost indestructible black box. When there is an accident, the box is opened, the data is analyzed, and the reason for the accident excavated. This ensures that procedures are adapted so that the same mistake doesn't happen again. With this method, the industry has created an astonishing safety record. For pilots working in a safety-critical industry, getting it wrong can have deadly consequences. But most of us have a relationship with failure that impedes progress, halts innovation, and damages our lives. We don't acknowledge it or learn from it —though we often think we do. Moving from anthropology to psychology and from history to complexity theory, Matthew Syed explains why even when we think we have 20/20 hindsight, our vision's still fuzzy. He offers a radical new idea: that the most important determinant of success in any field, whether sports, business, or life, is an acknowledgment of failure and a willingness to engage with it. This is how we learn, progress and excel. This approach explains everything from biological evolution and the efficiency of markets to the success of the Mercedes F1 team and the mindset of David Beckham. Using a cornucopia of interviews, gripping stories, and sharp-edged science, Syed explores the intimate relationship between failure and success, and shows why we need to transport black box thinking into our own lives. If we wish to unleash our potential, we must diagnose and break free of our failures. Part manifesto for change, part intellectual adventure, this groundbreaking book reveals how to do both.\n",

      "Leonardo was the first modern man to invent a robot capable of movement. He also designed a digital computer and made the first artificial heart valves. Today we appreciate Leonardo as a painter who turned Renaissance art upside down. His contemporaries praised him as a scientist who, with his pioneering discoveries, was able to ring a bell, heralding the start of a new era and inventing a new way of thinking. Leonardo was the first modern man to invent a robot capable of movement. He also designed a digital computer and made the first artificial heart valves. Today we appreciate Leonardo as a painter who turned Renaissance art upside down. His contemporaries praised him as a scientist who, with his pioneering discoveries, was able to ring a bell, heralding the start of a new era and inventing a new way of thinking. Leonardo da Vinci connected different fields of knowledge in an unprecedented way, at once intuitive, at once innovative, and free from taboos. Bestselling author Stefan Klein has decoded the legacy of this all-encompassing genius and shown us how, today more than ever, we can learn from his way of thinking. He has revealed the secret of the Mona Lisa, explained Leonardo’s love of water, and explained the real reason behind his dream of flying. Stefan Klein tells us about a man in whom we can see ourselves, about the passion for knowledge and the melancholy of want and need.\n",

The keys to this empire belong to the powerful North family - composed of successive generations of clones. Yet these clones are not identical. For one thing, genetic errors h A century from now, thanks to a technology allowing instantaneous travel across light-years, humanity has solved its energy shortages, cleaned up the environment, and created far-flung colony worlds. The keys to this empire belong to the powerful North family - composed of successive generations of clones. Yet these clones are not identical. For one thing, genetic errors have crept in with each generation. For another, the original three clone \"brothers\" have gone their separate ways, and the branches of the family are now friendly rivals more than allies.  Or maybe not so friendly. At least that's what the murder of a North clone in the English city of Newcastle suggests to Detective Sidney Hurst. Sid is a solid investigator who'd like nothing better than to hand off this hot potato of a case. The way he figures it, whether he solves the crime or not, he'll make enough enemies to ruin his career. Yet Sid's case is about to take an unexpected turn: Because the circumstances of the murder bear an uncanny resemblance to a killing that took place years ago on the planet St. Libra, where a North clone and his entire household were slaughtered in cold blood. The convicted slayer, Angela Tramelo, has always claimed her innocence. And now it seems she may have been right. Because only the St. Libra killer could have committed the Newcastle crime. Problem is, Angela also claims that the murderer was an alien monster.  Now Sid must navigate through a Byzantine minefield of competing interests within the police department and the world's political and economic elite...all the while hunting down a brutal killer poised to strike again. And on St. Libra, Angela, newly released from prison, joins a mission to hunt down the elusive alien, only to learn that the line between hunter and hunted is a thin one.\n",

These texts supply evidence crucial to an understanding of the bizarre mix of Quranic scholarship, CIA training, punctual interventions in Gulf politics and messianic anti-imperialism that has formed the programmatic core of Al Qaeda. In bringing together the various statements issued under bin Laden's name since 1994, this volume forms part of a growing discourse that seeks to demythologize the terrorist network. Newly translated from the Arabic, annotated with a critical introduction by Islamic scholar Bruce Lawrence, this collection places the statements in their religious, historical and political context. It shows how bin Laden's views draw on and differ from other strands of radical Islamic thought; it also demonstrates how his arguments vary in degrees of consistency, and how his evasions concerning the true nature and extent of his own group, and over his own role in terrorist attacks, have contributed to the perpetuation of his personal mythology.\n",

From the time she was a child, Mona Lisa knew she was different-but she never knew how different until a man of otherworldly beauty appeared during her night shift in the ER. Gryphon is hurting and hunted and he attracts her as no man ever has before. He is a Monère, one of the children of the moon-and what's more, so is she. Long exiled from the moon, the men of the Monère serve-and mate-with imperious Queens who can channel the rays of their far-off homeland. Gryphon believes that Mona Lisa is a Queen- perhaps the first of Mixed Blood ever known. But her introduction to the nighttime court of the Monère, simmering with intrigue, casual lust, and calculated cruelty, is far from smooth. The other Queens are infuriated by her potential powers, and they are all menaced by a group of rogue males who have broken away from the women's sway. Even as she battles threats from within and without, Mona Lisa is determined to discover who she is, and to explore the limits of her growing power-and her secret desires.\n",

      "Anyone who contemplates the present state of Muslims today, and what led them to their current state of weakness and division, will find it similar and close to their situation when they were sitting on the throne of Andalusia. He will see the same reasons for defeat and weaknesses, and the neglect of opportunities for leadership, strength and unity, with the difference in geography and names. From here came this comprehensive historical study of the history of Andalusia, which aims to read history with a keen eye that summarizes lessons and positions. Anyone who contemplates the present state of Muslims today, and what led them to their current state of weakness and division, will find it similar and close to their situation when they were sitting on the throne of Andalusia. He will see the same reasons for defeat and weaknesses, and the neglect of opportunities for leadership, strength and unity, with the difference in geography and names. From here came this comprehensive historical study of the history of Andalusia, which aims to read history with a keen eye that summarizes lessons and positions, in order to alert the heedless and remind the wise of the history of Islam and Muslims. The first chapter, The Islamic Conquest, discusses the objectives and reasons for the Islamic conquests. Then, it discusses the beginnings of the conquest of Morocco in general and Andalusia in particular, and sheds light on who assumed the emirate of Andalusia from the rulers of the Umayyad state. The second chapter of the study, entitled \"The Umayyad State in Andalusia: The Amazing Story\", is devoted to Abd al-Rahman I, how he fled from the Abbasids' pursuit, then entered Andalusia and assumed its emirate, then who took over after him from his Umayyad dynasty. This chapter is concluded by discussing the era of al-Hajeb al-Mansur. As for the third chapter, \"The Taifa States and the Kings of Morocco\", it discusses the dispersion of Andalusia into states and taifas, and discusses the events of that era and its kings. Then, it moves on to discuss the era of the Almoravids, who unified Andalusia after its division. Then, it concludes the chapter by discussing the era of the Almohads and their princes and its overlap with the history of Andalusia, as the princes of Morocco were the ones who ruled Andalusia after the era of the Taifas. The fourth chapter, “The End of Andalusia,” spoke about the painful end of that state that the Muslims made the capital of the world and the pearl of the West. It stopped at the betrayals that led to this result with the end of the Muslims there and the shame, humiliation, and injustice that befell them after their enemies defeated them. All of this was discussed within a complete and comprehensive historical sequence and a conscious reading of the events. This is what makes this book the reference that speaks through words, colored pictures, and an explanatory map about the history of Andalusia with this comprehensiveness and this arrangement.\n",

Now Kaufman and Mack return, introducing a character with a unique voice you'll never forget: Cassie Shaw, an irrepressible young woman who reinvents herself—with unexpected consequences—in a funny, wise, and utterly original novel about friendship, love, wildlife, and other forces of nature. In the wilds of Topanga Canyon, Cassie is right at home—with the call of birds, the sound of wind in the trees, the harmony of a world without people. But everywhere else, life is a little harder for Cassie. Her mother believes in Big Foot. Her wisecracking pet parrot is a drama queen. And at the age of thirty, newly single and without a college degree, Cassie desperately needs a decent paycheck. Which is why, against all her principles, she lies on her résumé for an office job at an elite university—and then finds herself employed in academia by two professors who are as rare as the birds she covets. One of her new bosses is Professor William Conner, a sexy, handsome, cheerfully aristocratic expert in animal behavior. Soon, under Conner's charismatic tutelage, Cassie carefully begins her personal transformation while meeting the kind of people who don't flock to wildlife preserves—from impossibly brilliant academics to adorably spoiled college boys. But her future—and unlikely new career—is teetering on one unbearable untruth. And Cassie's masquerade is about to come undone…in a chain of events that will transform her life—and the lives of those around her—forever. A novel for late bloomers of every exotic shade and stripe    is pure entertainment—at once hilarious and wry, lyrical and uplifting.\n",

For the first time, Steve is forced to think about who he is as he faces prison, where he may spend all the tomorrows of his life. As a way of coping with the horrific events that entangle him, Steve, an amateur filmmaker, decides to transcribe his trial into a script, just like in the movies. He writes it all down, scene by scene, the story of how his whole life was turned around in an instant. But despite his efforts, reality is blurred and his vision obscured until he can no longer tell who he is or what is the truth. This compelling novel is Walter Dean Myers's writing at its best.\n",

The focus of the book, however, remains its timeless guidance and advice--that careful analysis of balance sheets is the primary road to investment success, with all other considerations little more than distractions. The authors had seen and survived the Great Depression as well as the political and financial instabilities of World War II and were now better able to outline a program for sensible and profitable investing in the latter half of the century.  marks the return of this long-out-of-print work to the investment canon. It will reacquaint you with the foundations of value investing--more relevant than ever in tumultuous twenty-first century markets--and allow you to own the third installment in what has come to be regarded as the most accessible and usable title in the history of investment publishing.\n",

It asks, and answers, provocative questions, such as: - Why did the British colonists invade Australia and not the Aborigines in England? - When and how was the primacy of profit born? - Why would there never be wealth without debt? - Where does the outrageous power of bankers come from? - What is behind the economic crises? - Is there hope for humanity to stop acting as a stupid virus that kills the organism it lives in? - What is money and why does democracy \"need\" it? As the author himself states: \"Although it does not focus on the Greek daily life of the last, sad years, the book deals with the great issues of the social economy that touch all people, everywhere, but in a way that, any reader who wants to, can use in order to see with a different eye the recent collapse of the Greek economy in the midst of a Europe in crisis, in a world that is unable to balance.

But then a priest delivers an orphan to her door. The another, and another... and together they thrive. The distinguished author of Praying for Sheetrock and two-time National Book award  A novel of tragedy and hope set in AIDS-torn Ethiopia. When Haregwoin Teferra's husband and daughter died within a few years of each other, her life is shattered and she becomes a recluse. But then a priest delivers an orphan to her door. The another, and another... and together they thrive. The distinguished author of Praying for Sheetrock and two-time National Book award finalist puts a human face on the AIDS crisis in Africa.  When Haregwoin Teferra's husband and 23-year-old daughter died within a few years of each other, her middle-class life in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, was shattered. Bereft and with little to live for, Haregwoin became a recluse. Her self-imposed exile to a hut near her daughter's grave was interrupted when a priest delivered first one, then another, orphaned teenager into her care. To everyone's surprise, the children thrived, and so did Haregwoin. As word spread, children of all ages began to appear at her modest home: an infant brought by a dying mother, an orphaned brother and sister whose grandfather was too poor to feed them, a baby left on her doorstep. Haregwoin's small compound became known as the rare place where ailing parents and impoverished families could safely leave their children. Soon Haregwoin was caring for sixty children, running an unofficial orphanage and day school, and learning first-hand about her country's and her continent's greatest challenge: the AIDS pandemic that is leaving millions of children without parents to care for them.  With the flair and grace of a novelist and the reportorial instincts of a seasoned journalist, Melissa Fay Greene gets to the heart of the AIDS crisis, in a story that is nevertheless one of hope. There Is No Me Without You is the story of Haregwoin and her children: a story of struggle and despair, but also of the triumph of saved lives, and the renewed happiness of children welcomed by adoptive parents in Ethiopia, America, and around the world. Haregewoin's remarkable story convinces us that the crisis in Africa touches every one of us in some fundamental way. At heart, this book is about children and the parents they need to care for them.\n",

Madly in love, Hell will have to endure \"his nihilistic speeches and his incomparable perversity\", that is to say discover love, this other hell. For her first novel, Lolita Pille, who is only 19, does not always avoid the trap of caricature and ease. It is her age. But she will be forgiven a lot because we feel in her a real rage to write to exorcise her demons. And then it happens that between two VIP parties her heroine reads and quotes Baudelaire and Léo Ferré. We hope that this literary fervor will be felt in a more mature way in her next novel.\n",

In   Margaret Cheney explores the brilliant and prescient mind of one of the twentieth century's greatest scientists and inventors. Called a madman by his enemies, a genius by others, and an enigma by nearly everyone, Nikola Tesla was, without a doubt, a trailblazing inventor who created astonishing, sometimes world-transforming devices that were virtually without theoretical precedent. Tesla not only discovered the rotating magnetic field -- the basis of most alternating-current machinery -- but also introduced us to the fundamentals of robotics, computers, and missile science. Almost supernaturally gifted, unfailingly flamboyant and neurotic, Tesla was troubled by an array of compulsions and phobias and was fond of extravagant, visionary experimentations. He was also a popular man-about-town, admired by men as diverse as Mark Twain and George Westinghouse, and adored by scores of society beauties.   From Tesla's childhood in Yugoslavia to his death in New York in the 1940s, Cheney paints a compelling human portrait and chronicles a lifetime of discoveries that radically altered -- and continue to alter -- the world in which we live.   is an in-depth look at the seminal accomplishments of a scientific wizard and a thoughtful examination of the obsessions and eccentricities of the man behind the science.\n",

In 1993, Castro attempted economic reform by allowing Cubans to use U.S. dollars and begin their own business ventures—\"a huge messy free-for-all.\" This time of confused, low-rent capitalism is the backdrop for Pedro Juan Gutierrez's gritty, powerful, and atmospheric novel-in-stories,   translated from the original Spanish version by Natasha Wimmer. Gutierrez, whose prose sings of grime and simple, hard-clay truths, much like the words of  , is a well-known member of the Latin American visual poetry movement and a magazine journalist living in Havana.   is written from the semiautobiographical point of view of Pedro Juan, a 40-year-old sex-starved ex-radio journalist cobbling together an existence by selling everything from himself to drugs to whatever he can get his hands on. \"Everything's worth something here,\" he writes. Pedro Juan is an ex-radio journalist because in a \"model\" communist society nothing bad is acceptable news. Through his tormented lead character, Gutierrez provides a window into his reasons for writing such a crude book. \"That's why I was disillusioned with journalism and why I started to write raw stories.... I write to jar people a little and force others to wake up and smell the shit.... That's how I terrorize cowards and mess with people who like to muzzle those of us who speak up.... My stories could run bare-assed out into the middle of the street, shouting, 'Freedom, freedom, freedom.'\" That said, be warned:   is not for the faint of heart. It is raw, squarely confronting poverty, racism, violence, prostitution, and the lengths Cubans go to in order to secure the almighty buck. In one story, the man who lives across the hall from Pedro Juan, in the crumbling apartment building that serves as the focal point for much of the book, is busted by the cops for stealing human livers from the morgue and selling them on the streets as pork livers. But survival isn't the only thing on the minds of Gutierrez's colorful characters. Oddly enough, it's the quest for release, for fits of pleasure, for some sliver of happiness no matter how warped the avenue may seem to the world outside Havana. And that quest is manifested in the hard-core sex that permeates the pages of the book. An orgasm is one of the few pleasures no one can be denied. As violent and nauseating as the sex -- and the life -- may seem on the surface, Gutierrez achieves the difficult task of lifting his characters from the muck, giving his   an intellectual and emotional depth that far outweighs the carnal. Near the end Gutierrez writes, \"Born in the ruins, they just kept trying not to give up or let themselves be beaten so severely that at last they were forced to surrender. Anything was possible, everything allowed, except defeat.\" The book then becomes a manifesto, a well-wrought fight against literary persecution, a release the same as an orgasm, where the truth behind every dark corner, behind every door, must be told.   comes from the same womb in which literature was born, a book that just may someday be held up beside those of the mighty dead.

He himself worked on the codification, but had not finished it when he died in 1957. The task was continued on the basis of his work, and the resulting volume was released in 1973. That publication included, in addition to the Synopsis and Codification itself and explanatory notes, a compilation of the passages from the Kitab-i-Aqdas which had already been translated by Shoghi Effendi and published in various books. The Synopsis and Codification covered the text of both the Kitab-i-Aqdas and the Questions and Answers which constitutes an appendix to the Aqdas. In 1986 the Universal House of Justice decided that the time had come when the preparation of an English translation of the complete text of the Most Holy Book was both possible and essential and made its accomplishment a goal of the Six Year Plan 1986-1992. Its publication in English will be followed by translations in other languages. It has been recognized that the Kitab-i-Aqdas, being Sacred Scripture, should be presented in a form which can be read with ease and inspiration, uncluttered with the footnotes and index numbers that are common in scholarly texts. Nonetheless, to assist the reader in following the flow of the text and its changing themes, paragraph divisions have been added—such divisions not being common in works of Arabic literature—and these paragraphs have then been numbered for ease of access and indexing, as well as for uniformity of reference in all the languages in which the work will be published. Following the text of the Aqdas is a brief compilation of Writings of Baha'u'llah which are supplementary to the Most Holy Book, and a translation of the Questions and Answers published here for the first time.

But once on board, things go wrong. Mattias collapses and wakes up on a deserted road, soaked, injured and – for some inexplicable reason – with 15,000 Norwegian kroner in his pocket.\n",

In the new historical novel by the author of \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,\" a sixteen-year-old boy is catapulted from the backlands of Russia to the opulence of the imperial court. There, for almost three years, he will witness, from the eye of the storm, events that completely changed the course of history in the 20th century. Can one escape from history? Is it possible to live in anonymity after a life of opulence and glory? Is ordinary life really that different from public life? Georgy Jachmenev spent his entire life struggling with these questions, and now, on the verge of losing the great love of his life, he tries to find an answer to them by reflecting on his journey through a 20th century that always seemed too long to him. His achievements began early: at sixteen, in an impulsive and clumsy act, the young man prevented an attempt on the life of none other than Grand Duke Nicholas Nicolaievich, brother of Tsar Nicholas II, who, in gratitude, appointed Georgy the official bodyguard of his son Alexei, destined to be the next tsar. An impressive turnaround, which took him from the Russian taiga to the opulence of Moscow's palaces, a setting that, despite the vastness and luxury of its immense corridors, would prove to be much more inhospitable than the cold caves of his previous life. The harsh experience of this icy world of palace intrigues, into which he was always thrown against his will, and of great tensions and responsibilities was only alleviated with the arrival of his first love, Zoya. But times were turbulent, and history left little room for idylls: when the Bolshevik Revolution took the country by storm, and isolated the entire Tsar's family in a country house on the outskirts of Yekaterinburg, once again Georgy had to act quickly in order to save himself and Zoya. Life with her would cost him his homeland, family and prestige, and he never regretted it - but what would it have cost Zoya? In a fascinating narrative, in which present and past converge in alternating chapters, from England during the Thatcher years to the era of the Russian czars, and from the difficult years of the Second World War to the turmoil of the Bolshevik Revolution, we follow Georgy in the midst of decisive historical events that end up being a mere backdrop for a love story that hides a great mystery, perhaps greater than the story itself.\n",

In a fit of preemptive grief and magical thinking, she sets out for a hike in the Galilee, leaving no forwarding information for the \"notifiers\" who might darken her door with the worst possible news. Recently estranged from her husband, Ilan, she drags along an unlikely companion: their former best friend and her former lover Avram, once a brilliant artistic spirit. Avram served in the army alongside Ilan when they were young, but their lives were forever changed one weekend when the two jokingly had Ora draw lots to see which of them would get the few days' leave being offered by their commander—a chance act that sent Avram into Egpyt and the Yom Kippur War, where he was brutally tortured as POW.  In the aftermath, a virtual hermit, he refused to keep in touch with the family and has never met the boy. Now, as Ora and Avram sleep out in the hills, ford rivers, and cross valleys, avoiding all news from the front, she gives him the gift of Ofer, word by word; she supplies the whole story of her motherhood, a retelling that keeps Ofer very much alive for Ora and for the reader, and opens Avram to human bonds undreamed of in his broken world. Their walk has a \"war and peace\" rhythm, as their conversation places the most hideous trials of war next to the joys and anguish of raising children. Never have we seen so clearly the reality and surreality of daily life in Israel, the currents of ambivalence about war within one household, and the burdens that fall on each generation anew.  Grossman's rich imagining of a family in love and crisis makes for one of the great antiwar novels of our time.\n",

Being as thin as possible was a way to make the job of being an actress easier . . .\"  Portia de Rossi weighed only 82 pounds when she collapsed on the set of the Hollywood film in which she was playing her first leading role. This should have been the culmination of \"I didn't decide to become anorexic. It snuck up on me disguised as a healthy diet, a professional attitude. Being as thin as possible was a way to make the job of being an actress easier . . .\"  Portia de Rossi weighed only 82 pounds when she collapsed on the set of the Hollywood film in which she was playing her first leading role. This should have been the culmination of all her years of hard work—first as a child model in Australia, then as a cast member of one of the hottest shows on American television. On the outside she was thin and blond, glamorous and successful. On the inside, she was literally dying.  In this searing, unflinchingly honest book, Portia de Rossi captures the complex emotional truth of what it is like when food, weight, and body image take priority over every other human impulse or action. She recounts the elaborate rituals around eating that came to dominate hours of every day, from keeping her daily calorie intake below 300 to eating precisely measured amounts of food out of specific bowls and only with certain utensils. When this wasn't enough, she resorted to purging and compulsive physical exercise, driving her body and spirit to the breaking point.  Even as she rose to fame as a cast member of the hit television shows Ally McBeal and Arrested Development, Portia alternately starved herself and binged, all the while terrified that the truth of her sexuality would be exposed in the tabloids. She reveals the heartache and fear that accompany a life lived in the closet, a sense of isolation that was only magnified by her unrelenting desire to be ever thinner. With the storytelling skills of a great novelist and the eye for detail of a poet, Portia makes transparent as never before the behaviors and emotions of someone living with an eating disorder.  From her lowest point, Portia began the painful climb back to a life of health and honesty, falling in love with and eventually marrying Ellen DeGeneres, and emerging as an outspoken and articulate advocate for gay rights and women's health issues.  In this remarkable and beautifully written work, Portia shines a bright light on a dark subject. A crucial book for all those who might sometimes feel at war with themselves or their bodies, Unbearable Lightness is a story that inspires hope and nourishes the spirit.\n",

The book deals with various aspects of a growing global movement towards rehabilitating slowness and confronting tendencies towards the worship of speed. Canadian author Karl Honoré used a smooth literary style based on his impressions, knowledge, visits and meetings with people who decided that “In Praise of Slowness: A Global Movement Challenging the Cult of Speed” achieved record sales and joined the list of best-selling books in many countries. The book deals with various aspects of a growing global movement towards rehabilitating slowness and confronting tendencies towards the worship of speed. The Canadian writer Carl Honoré used a smooth literary style based on his impressions, knowledge, visits and meetings with people who decided to participate, in one way or another, in the slow movement that is raging in the industrial world, from Japan in the East to the United States in the West, in a narrative story format that is often based on studies, numbers and sometimes dialogue. The writer begins by explaining the map of the human crisis with time, with the hands of the clock, and with appointments, then provides a glimpse of the global slow movement, and monitors its interesting features. He then proceeds through the chapters of the book to the details of the manifestations of this movement in various aspects of modern human life in the twenty-first century: food, urbanization, the duality of mind and body, medicine, sex, work, recreation, and raising children. He devoted a special chapter to each aspect, equipped with a large number of experiences, interviews and enjoyable stories, which gave the book a comprehensive applied character as well.\n",

It sounds too good to be true, and she realizes she might only be exchanging one prison for another. When she challenges the ambassador, Bran, to remove her kundar, the hated collar that keeps her magic in check, he hesitates. She is a beautiful, exotic creature, but from the rumors he's heard, the collar is the only thing that will keep her from turning on him, and he needs her help to find the elixir sym, that threatens to destroy his country. A precarious alliance forms between them, and their journey begins. But it quickly becomes filled with treachery and deceit. Teya must learn who she really is, for if she fails, her people and the magic they weld are lost forever. Now, as she nears the completion of her journey, she realizes the path she is destined to take will also tear her from the man she loves. Can she give up everything she is for him?\n",

Forster, Virginia Woolf, Ernest Hemingway, Bertrand Russell, Lionel Trilling, Chiua Achebe, and Philip Gourevitch \"Heart of Darkness,\" which appeared at the very beginning of our century, was a Cassandra cry announcing the end of Victo With an Introduction by Caryl Phillips Commentary by H.L. Mencken, E.M. Forster, Virginia Woolf, Ernest Hemingway, Bertrand Russell, Lionel Trilling, Chiua Achebe, and Philip Gourevitch \"Heart of Darkness,\" which appeared at the very beginning of our century, was a Cassandra cry announcing the end of Victorian Europe, on the verge of transforming itself into the Europe of violence,\" wrote the critic Czeslaw Milosz.          Originally published in 1902, Heart of Darkness remains one of this century's most enduring--and harrowing--works of fiction. Written several years after Conrad's grueling sojourn in the Belgian Congo, the novel tells the story of Marlow, a seaman who undertakes his own journey into the African jungle to find the tormented white trader Kurtz. Rich in irony and spellbinding prose, Heart of Darkness is a complex meditation on colonialism, evil, and the thin line between civilization and barbarity. This edition contains selections from Conrad's Congo Diary of 1890--the first notes, in effect, for the novel which was composed at the end of that decade. Virginia Woolf wrote of Conrad, \"His books are full of moments of vision. They light up a whole character in a flash. . . .  He could not write badly, one feels, to save his life.\"\n",

When World War II ended, I was in my fifth year, and I saw Japan defeated and lived with my family facing our fate without any support. We had nothing in the face of hunger, deprivation, weather conditions, and others. I accompanied the reconstruction process, I lived with my family in Tokyo, and Tokyo was completely demolished, neighborhood by neighborhood, street by street. In the last days of the war, I knew all of this, and I also knew the results of the process of correcting mistakes, and I myself enjoyed the fruits of Japan's economic recovery. Then I traveled to the Arab countries when I was over thirty years old and I saw, read and talked to people everywhere I went. I personally experienced the absence of social justice, the marginalization and humiliation of citizens, the spread of oppression in a way that is not befitting of a human being, and the absence of types of freedom such as freedom of opinion, belief, behavior, etc. I also learned up close how society sacrifices talented and loyal individuals, and I saw how people’s behavior is dominated by a lack of a sense of responsibility towards society and towards the homeland. Therefore, simple and difficult questions accompanied me: Why don’t Arabs benefit from their experiences? Why don’t Arabs criticize their mistakes? Why do Arabs repeat the same mistakes? We know that correcting mistakes takes a short or long time. There is a time for everything, but the question is: How much time do Arabs need to benefit from their experiences, correct their mistakes, and put themselves on the right path?! In short, I want to tell the Arab reader my opinion on some of his issues as I see them from the outside like any foreigner who has lived in Arab countries, read Arabic literature, and is interested in daily life in the city, countryside, and desert.\n",

A Harvard-trained Palestinian doctor who was born and raised in the Jabalia refugee camp in the Gaza Strip and \"who has devoted his life to medicine and reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians\" ( ), Abuelaish has been crossing the lines in the sand that divide Israelis and Palestinians for most of his life - as a physician who treats patients on both sides of the line, as a humanitarian who sees the need for improved health and education for women as the way forward in the Middle East. And, most recently, as the father whose daughters were killed by Israeli soldiers on January 16, 2009, during Israel's incursion into the Gaza Strip.

A Harvard-trained Palestinian doctor who was born and raised in the Jabalia refugee camp in the Gaza Strip and \"who has devoted his life to medicine and reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians\" ( ), Abuelaish has been crossing the lines in the sand that divide Israelis and Palestinians for most of his life - as a physician who treats patients on both sides of the line, as a humanitarian who sees the need for improved health and education for women as the way forward in the Middle East. And, most recently, as the father whose daughters were killed by Israeli soldiers on January 16, 2009, during Israel's incursion into the Gaza Strip. His response to this tragedy made news and won him humanitarian awards around the world.

Compellingly told by two Boston Globe reporters who were on the case from the beginning, Black Mass is at once a riveting crime story, a cautionary tale about the abuse of power, and a penetrating look at Boston and its Irish population.\n",

From ordinary obligations such as applying for a passport or sharing a holiday meal with relatives, he takes extraordinary flights of imagination; in extreme moments, such as the terrifying days following a cataclysmic earthquake in Istanbul, he lays bare our most basic hopes and fears.

We donate our time and money to charities and causes we deem worthy, choose careers we consider meaningful, and patronize businesses and buy products we believe make the world a better place. Unfortunately, we often base these decisions on assumptions and emotions rather than facts. As a result, even our best intentions often lead to ineffective—and sometimes downright harmful—outcomes. How can we do better?  While a researcher at Oxford, trying to figure out which career would allow him to have the greatest impact, William MacAskill confronted this problem head on. He discovered that much of the potential for change was being squandered by lack of information, bad data, and our own prejudice. As an antidote, he and his colleagues developed effective altruism, a practical, data-driven approach that allows each of us to make a tremendous difference regardless of our resources. Effective altruists believe that it's not enough to simply do good; we must do good better.  At the core of this philosophy are five key questions that help guide our altruistic decisions: How many people benefit, and by how much? Is this the most effective thing I can do? Is this area neglected? What would have happened otherwise? What are the chances of success, and how good would success be? By applying these questions to real-life scenarios, MacAskill shows how many of our assumptions about doing good are misguided. For instance, he argues one can potentially save more lives by becoming a plastic surgeon rather than a heart surgeon; measuring overhead costs is an inaccurate gauge of a charity's effectiveness; and, it generally doesn't make sense for individuals to donate to disaster relief.  MacAskill urges us to think differently, set aside biases, and use evidence and careful reasoning rather than act on impulse. When we do this—when we apply the head  the heart to each of our altruistic endeavors—we find that each of us has the power to do an astonishing amount of good.\n",

Once, Abrielle's name was on the lips of every unwed nobleman in London as a proud exceptional lady coveted for her bearing, her breeding, her wit, and her beauty. But when her stepfather—respected for his courage and valor during the Crusades—is denied his rightful title and the wealth that accompanies it, Abrielle finds herself suddenly disgraced, no longer a suitable match for any proper gentleman. Only one would still have her, though he desires no more than physical pleasure: the oafish and grotesque Desmond de Marlé. His dark and scandalous reputation is legend, and Abrielle has heard rumors that his first two wives perished by his hand. Yet no one else can rescue her once-proud family's honor and keep her stepfather from debtor's prison, so she is left with no choice but to accept the cruel and hateful de Marlé's offer of marriage and sacrifice her virtue to a scoundrel she fears and detests . . . even as she yearns for another lover. Dashing, handsome, tall, and kind—a black-haired Scotsman with vivid blue eyes—Raven Seabern is an emissary for his king, and quite unlike any man Abrielle has ever encountered. From the very first moment their eyes meet, he intrigues and mesmerizes her—and dancing in his arms at a royal banquet leaves her weak with the desire to surrender. But their love can never be, for Abrielle is betrothed to a monster. And the well-being of everyone she cares for demands that she honor her promise. Still, the fire lit that night will not be doused. Raven knows he has found the true one and must never let her go—though secrets, deceptions, dishonor, and unimaginable peril will surely be their fate if they follow the dictates of their hearts.\n",

Ülkede yaşayanların boğazlarının içinden geçen dev bir köprü. Çıplak ayağı Doğu'da, ayakkabılı olanı Batı'da ve üzerinden yasadışı ne varsa geçip giden, yaşlı bir köprü. Kursağımızdan geçiyordu hepsi. Özellikle de, kaçak denilen insanlar… Elimizden geleni yapıyorduk... Boğazımıza takılmasınlar diye. Yutkunup  gönderiyorduk hepsini. Nereye gideceklerse oraya… Sınırdan sınıra ticaret… Duvardan duvara…\"\n",
      "Leave people helpless, they make rockets from their internal organs! As you read this sentence, somewhere, people are getting ready to set off on a pitch-black journey to escape from war, hunger and poverty in their countries. However, this story is not about those illegal immigrants, but about one of their kidnappers. His name is Gaza. His father is a human smuggler, and Gaza is his apprentice. He is only 9 years old. In other words, he is old enough to learn everything he shouldn't about life and people. \"The difference between the East and the West is Turkey. I don't know which one you take away from which and what remains is Turkey, but I'm sure the distance between them is as much as Turkey. And we were living there. In a country where politicians go on TV every day and talk about its geopolitical importance. At first I couldn't figure out what it meant. It turns out that geopolitical importance means the profit calculations made with the block and parcel numbers of a dilapidated building where buses, whose interior is pitch black and whose headlights are wide open, take a break in the middle of the night just because it's on the road. It means a huge Bosphorus Bridge, 1,565 km long. A giant bridge passing through the throats of the people living in the country. An old bridge that passes through the bare feet in the East, the ones with shoes in the West and everything illegal. They were all passing through our throats. Especially the so-called illegals... We were doing our best... So that they wouldn't get stuck in our throats. We were swallowing and sending them all away. Wherever they were going... Trade from border to border... Wall to wall...\"\n",

She is alone and unsure of where to go, until Esther, a member of her cell, finds her and delivers a message that chills Chaya to her core, and sends her on a journey toward an even larger uprising in the works — in the Warsaw Ghetto.\n",

First published in 2007,  No novel in recent memory has spoken more movingly to contemporary readers about the nature of love than André Aciman's haunting  . First published in 2007, it was hailed as \"a love letter, an invocation . . . an exceptionally beautiful book\" (Stacey D'Erasmo,  ). Nearly three quarters of a million copies have been sold, and the book became a much-loved, Academy Award–winning film starring Timothée Chalamet as the young Elio and Armie Hammer as Oliver, the graduate student with whom he falls in love. In  , Aciman shows us Elio's father, Samuel, on a trip from Florence to Rome to visit Elio, who has become a gifted classical pianist. A chance encounter on the train with a beautiful young woman upends Sami's plans and changes his life forever. Elio soon moves to Paris, where he, too, has a consequential affair, while Oliver, now a New England college professor with a family, suddenly finds himself contemplating a return trip across the Atlantic. Aciman is a master of sensibility, of the intimate details and the emotional nuances that are the substance of passion.   brings us back inside the magic circle of one of our greatest contemporary romances to ask if, in fact, true love ever dies.\n",

The \"last great mystery of science,\" consciousness was excluded from serious research for most of the last century but is now a rapidly expanding area of study for students of psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience. Recently the topic has also captured growing popular interest.   This groundbreaking book is the first volume to bring together all the major theories of consciousness studies--from those rooted in traditional Western philosophy to those coming out of neuroscience, quantum theory, and Eastern philosophy. Broadly interdisciplinary, Consciousness: AnIntroduction is divided into nine sections that examine such topics as how subjective experiences arise from objective brain processes, the basic neuroscience and neuropathology of consciousness, altered states of consciousness, mystical experiences and dreams, and the effects of drugs and meditation. It also discusses the nature of self, the possibility of artificial consciousness in robots, and the question of whether or not animals are conscious. Enhanced by numerous illustrations and profiles of important researchers, the book also includes self-assessment questions, further reading suggestions, and practical exercises that help bring the subject to life.\n",

      "A collection of short stories \"What is madness? It seems to be a mysterious state like life and death. You can know a lot about it if you look at it from the outside. As for the interior, as for the essence, it is a closed secret. And here he now knows that he was a guest for a while in the Khanka. And he remembers, now too, his past life as all sane people remember it, and as he knows his present. As for that short period, it was short, thank God, his consciousness stands in front of its memories, astonished and confused, not knowing anything about it that would reassure the soul. It was a journey to a strange, ethereal world. Full of fog, his eyes imagine faces with unclear features, whenever he tries to shine a glimmer of light on them from memory, they flee and are swallowed by darkness. Sometimes his ears hear something like a murmur from it, and as soon as he listens carefully to distinguish their locations, they flee and retreat in silence and confusion. That magical period with its joy and pain was lost, even those who lived through its wondrous era. They have drawn a thick curtain of silence and ignorance over it for an undisguised wisdom, so it vanished without a trustworthy historian being available to tell of its wonders. How did it happen?! When did it happen? How did people realize that this mind had become something other than the mind? And that his owner has become an odd individual who must be isolated from people as if he were a predatory animal.” Naguib Mahfouz says in one of his interviews that his greatest pleasure was those hours when he would sit on the corner of a popular neighborhood. And that is truly what the reader feels when he continues reading Naguib Mahfouz through his collection of short stories “Whispers of Madness.” That writer was not merely a transmitter of those images that animated the scenes of his narratives; rather, he was skilled in his depiction of the human soul with the different characters that filled his stories. He was honest to the point that the reader, having shed his place, and the writer, being transported to his world filled with those stories that, with their analyses and digressions, represent a part of reality, indeed the whole reality.\n",

Baby Boy Fisher--as he was documented in his child welfare caseworkers' reports--was raised in institutions from the moment of his birth in prison to a single mother. After beginning his life in an orphanage, Antwone was placed in a temporary foster home until, around age two, he was transferred to a second foster home. It was there, over the next thirteen years, that he endured emotional abandonment and physical abuse. Removed from this foster home not long before his sixteenth birthday, Antwone found fleeting refuge in a boys' reform school but was soon thrust into the nightmare of homelessness. Though convinced he was unwanted and unworthy, Fish, as he came to be known, refused to allow his spirit to be broken. Instead, he became determined to raise himself, to listen to social workers and teachers who intervened on his behalf, and to nurture a romantic heart along with a scathing sense of humor and a wondrous imagination--all of which sustained him with big dreams of a better day. Fatefully, just as Antwone's life on the streets hit rock bottom, he enlisted in the United States Navy, where he remained for the next eleven years. During that time, Fish became a man of the world, raised by the Navy family he created for himself. Finding Fish shows how, out of this unlikely mix of deprivation and hope, an artist was born--first as the child who painted the feelings his words dared not speak, then as a poet and storyteller who would eventually become one of Hollywood's most well-paid, sought-after screenwriters. But before he ascends those lofty steps, Antwone's story takes us from the Navy to his jobs as a federal correctional officer and then a security guard at Sony Pictures in Hollywood. In its climactic conclusion, the mystery of his identity is finally unraveled as Antwone returns to Cleveland to locate his mother's and father's surviving family members. A tumultuous and ultimately gratifying tale of self-discovery written in Fisher's gritty yet melodic literary voice, Finding Fish is an unforgettable reading experience.\n",

In this first volume of the Liberation Trilogy, Rick Atkinson shows why no modern reader can understand the ultimate victory of the Allied powers without a grasp of the great drama that unfolded in North Africa in 1942 and 1943. That first year of the Allied war was a pivotal point in American history, the moment when the United States began to act like a great power. Beginning with the daring amphibious invasion in November 1942, An Army at Dawn follows the American and British armies as they fight the French in Morocco and Algeria, and then take on the Germans and Italians in Tunisia. Battle by battle, an inexperienced and sometimes poorly led army gradually becomes a superb fighting force. Central to the tale are the extraordinary but fallible commanders who come to dominate the battlefield: Eisenhower, Patton, Bradley, Montgomery, and Rommel. Brilliantly researched, rich with new material and vivid insights, Atkinson's narrative provides the definitive history of the war in North Africa.\n",

This is a war of magic, not of swords, and the battles are fought deep inside the View, In a world where technology is magic, and war is the only way of life, Talyn is a soldier, one of thousands trained from childhood to protect her country from the monarchist Eastil, who would take away the personal freedoms of the Tonk.

But the Feegash came from across the world, and demanded to be allowed to negotiate peace between the Eastil and the Tonk for the sake of the rest of the world. Their success meant Talyn was out of a job, and at a loss for what to do with her life. Rather than follow most of her fellow soldiers to jobs in other parts of the world, Talyn stayed with her family in her town--and there she is seduced by a Feegash diplomat. With him she experiences a dark side of herself that she hadn't even imagined, and learns a new kind of magery. And she discovers the mistreatment of Eastil prisoners of war, still in Tonk hands, and weighs her life against saving theirs. It's a matter of honor--and her honor will be challenged again and again as she slowly discovers that what the Feegash have brought with them was not peace but an overwhelming oppression, and an evil so insidious no one noticed it until it was too late. But if Talyn can hone her use of the Feegash flesh-magery, she can turn their own magic back against them. With the help of one of the Eastil prisoners, she might be able to use it to save the Tonk andthe Eastil, and defeat the Feegash once and for all... if it doesn't destroy her from the inside out first.\n",

It is 1957, and Lewis Aldridge, straight out of prison, is journeying back to his home in Waterford, a suburban town outside London. He is nineteen years old, and his return will have dramatic consequences not just for his family, but for the whole community.  A decade earlier, his father's homecoming has a very different effect. The war is over and Gilbert has been demobilized. He reverts easily to suburban life—cocktails at six-thirty, church on Sundays—but his wife and young son resist the stuffy routine. Lewis and his mother escape to the woods for picnics, just as they did in wartime days. Nobody is surprised that Gilbert's wife counters convention, but they are all shocked when, after one of their jaunts, Lewis comes back without her.  Not far away, Kit Carmichael keeps watch. She has always understood more than most, not least from what she is dealt by her own father's hand. Lewis's grief and burgeoning rage are all too plain, and Kit makes a private vow to help. But in her attempts to set them both free, she fails to foresee the painful and horrifying secrets that must first be forced into the open.  In this brilliant debut, Sadie Jones tells the story of a boy who refuses to accept the polite lies of a tightly knit community that rejects love in favor of appearances. Written with nail-biting suspense and cinematic pacing, The Outcast is an emotionally powerful evocation of postwar provincial English society and a remarkably uplifting testament to the redemptive powers of love and understanding.\n",

Newly graduated from college and an aspiring writer, Beth Hayes craves independence and has a world to conquer. But her notions of travel, graduate study, and writing the great American novel will have to be postponed. With her mother, Susan, leaving to fulfill her own dreams in Paris and her Aunt Maggie, Uncle Grant, and stepfather, Simon, moving to California, Beth is elected by her elders to house-sit the Island Gamble. Surrounded by the shimmering blue waters of the Atlantic, the white clapboards, silver tin roof, and confessional porch have seen and heard the stories of generations of Hamiltons. But will the ghosts of the Island Gamble be watching over Beth? Buoyed by sentimental memories of growing up on this tiny sandbar that seems to be untouched by time, Beth vows to give herself over to the Lowcountry force and discover the wisdom it holds. She will rest, rejuvenate, and then reenter the outside world. Just as she vows she will never give into the delusional world of white picket fences, minivans, and eternal love, she meets Max Mitchell. And all her convictions and plans begin to unravel with lightning speed. There is so much about life and her family's past that she does not know. Her ignorance and naiveté nearly cost her both her inheritance and her family's respect. But Beth finds unexpected friends to help her through the disaster she faces: her wise and charming Aunt Sophie; Cecily Singleton, the granddaughter of Livvie Singleton; and Woody Morrison, the solid young investment banker. This wonderful ensemble of characters could be your own family, but watch what unfolds as they succumb to the island's spell. If everything happens for a reason, then Beth's return to Sullivans Island teaches her that betrayal and tragedy are most easily handled when you surround yourself with loyal family and friends in a magical place that loves you so much that it wants to claim you as its own.\n",

And all of us have stopped to wonder, at some time or another, what it is that makes these people tick. What makes them run? This is the question Schulberg has asked himself, and the answer is the first novel written with the indignation that only a young writer with talent and ideals could concentrate into a manuscript. It is the story of Sammy Glick, the man with a positive genius for being a heel, who runs through New York's East Side, through newspaper ranks and finally through Hollywood, leaving in his wake the wrecked careers of his associates; for this is his tragedy and his chief characteristic—his congenital incapacity for friendship. An older and more experienced novelist might have tempered his story and, in so doing, destroyed one of its outstanding qualities. Compromise would mar the portrait of Sammy Glick. Schulberg has etched it in pure vitriol, and dissected his victim with a precision that is almost frightening. When a fragment of this book appeared as a short story in a national magazine, Schulberg was surprised at the number of letters he received from people convinced they knew Sammy Glick's real name. But speculation as to his real identity would be utterly fruitless, for Sammy is a composite picture of a loud and spectacular minority bitterly resented by the many decent and sincere artists who are trying honestly to realize the measureless potentialities of motion pictures. To this group belongs Schulberg himself, who has not only worked as a screen writer since his graduation from Dartmouth College in 1936, but has spent his life, literally, in the heart of the motion-picture colony. In the course of finding out what makes Sammy run (an operation in which the reader is spared none of the grue-some details) Schulberg has poured out everything he has felt about that place. The result is a book which the publishers not only believe to be the most honest ever written about Hollywood, but a penetrating study of one kind of twentieth-century success that is peculiar to no single race of people or walk of life.\n",

At sixteen, she has become a global symbol of peaceful protest and the youngest nominee ever for the Nobel Peace Prize. I AM MALALA is the remarkable tale of a family uprooted by global terrorism, of the fight for girls' education, of a father who, himself a school owner, championed and encouraged his daughter to write and attend school, and of brave parents who have a fierce love for their daughter in a society that prizes sons.

      "The Skull Throne of Krasia stands empty.   Built from the skulls of fallen generals and demon princes, it is a seat of honor and ancient, powerful magic, keeping the demon corelings at bay. From atop the throne, Ahmann Jardir was meant to conquer the known world, forging its isolated peoples into a unified army to rise up and end the demon war once and for all.   But Arlen Bal The Skull Throne of Krasia stands empty.   Built from the skulls of fallen generals and demon princes, it is a seat of honor and ancient, powerful magic, keeping the demon corelings at bay. From atop the throne, Ahmann Jardir was meant to conquer the known world, forging its isolated peoples into a unified army to rise up and end the demon war once and for all.   But Arlen Bales, the Warded Man, stood against this course, challenging Jardir to a duel he could not in honor refuse. Rather than risk defeat, Arlen cast them both from a precipice, leaving the world without a savior, and opening a struggle for succession that threatens to tear the Free Cities of Thesa apart.   In the south, Inevera, Jardir's first wife, must find a way to keep their sons from killing each other and plunging their people into civil war as they strive for glory enough to make a claim on the throne.   In the north, Leesha Paper and Rojer Inn struggle to forge an alliance between the duchies of Angiers and Miln against the Krasians before it is too late.   Caught in the crossfire is the duchy of Lakton--rich and unprotected, ripe for conquest.   All the while, the corelings have been growing stronger, and without Arlen and Jardir there may be none strong enough to stop them. Only Renna Bales may know more about the fate of the missing men, but she, too, has disappeared...\n",

      "In 1930, the American historian and philosopher Will Durant wrote that Britain's 'conscious and deliberate bleeding of India… [was the] greatest crime in all history'. He was not the only one to denounce the rapacity and cruelty of British rule, and his assessment was not exaggerated. Almost thirty-five million Indians died because of acts of commission and omission by the In 1930, the American historian and philosopher Will Durant wrote that Britain's 'conscious and deliberate bleeding of India… [was the] greatest crime in all history'. He was not the only one to denounce the rapacity and cruelty of British rule, and his assessment was not exaggerated. Almost thirty-five million Indians died because of acts of commission and omission by the British—in famines, epidemics, communal riots and wholesale slaughter like the reprisal killings after the 1857 War of Independence and the Amritsar massacre of 1919.  Besides the deaths of Indians, British rule impoverished India in a manner that beggars belief. When the East India Company took control of the country, in the chaos that ensued after the collapse of the Mughal empire, India's share of world GDP was 23 per cent. When the British left it was just above 3 per cent.  The British empire in India began with the East India Company, incorporated in 1600, by royal charter of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth I, to trade in silk, spices and other profitable Indian commodities. Within a century and a half, the Company had become a power to reckon with in India. In 1757, under the command of Robert Clive, Company forces defeated the ruling Nawab Siraj-ud-Daula of Bengal at Plassey, through a combination of superior artillery and even more superior chicanery. A few years later, the young and weakened Mughal emperor, Shah Alam II, was browbeaten into issuing an edict that replaced his own revenue officials with the Company's representatives. Over the next several decades, the East India Company, backed by the British government, extended its control over most of India, ruling with a combination of extortion, double-dealing, and outright corruption backed by violence and superior force. This state of affairs continued until 1857, when large numbers of the Company's Indian soldiers spearheaded the first major rebellion against colonial rule. After the rebels were defeated, the British Crown took over power and ruled the country ostensibly more benignly until 1947, when India won independence.  In this explosive book, bestselling author Shashi Tharoor reveals with acuity, impeccable research, and trademark wit, just how disastrous British rule was for India. Besides examining the many ways in which the colonizers exploited India, ranging from the drain of national resources to Britain, the destruction of the Indian textile, steel-making and shipping industries, and the negative transformation of agriculture, he demolishes the arguments of Western and Indian apologists for Empire on the supposed benefits of British rule, including democracy and political freedom, the rule of law, and the railways.   The few unarguable benefits—the English language, tea, and cricket—were never actually intended for the benefit of the colonized but introduced to serve the interests of the colonizers. Brilliantly narrated and passionately argued,   will serve to correct many misconceptions about one of the most contested periods of Indian history.\n",

Almost thirty-five million Indians died because of acts of commission and omission by the In 1930, the American historian and philosopher Will Durant wrote that Britain's 'conscious and deliberate bleeding of India… [was the] greatest crime in all history'. He was not the only one to denounce the rapacity and cruelty of British rule, and his assessment was not exaggerated. Almost thirty-five million Indians died because of acts of commission and omission by the British—in famines, epidemics, communal riots and wholesale slaughter like the reprisal killings after the 1857 War of Independence and the Amritsar massacre of 1919.  Besides the deaths of Indians, British rule impoverished India in a manner that beggars belief. When the East India Company took control of the country, in the chaos that ensued after the collapse of the Mughal empire, India's share of world GDP was 23 per cent. When the British left it was just above 3 per cent.  The British empire in India began with the East India Company, incorporated in 1600, by royal charter of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth I, to trade in silk, spices and other profitable Indian commodities. Within a century and a half, the Company had become a power to reckon with in India. In 1757, under the command of Robert Clive, Company forces defeated the ruling Nawab Siraj-ud-Daula of Bengal at Plassey, through a combination of superior artillery and even more superior chicanery. A few years later, the young and weakened Mughal emperor, Shah Alam II, was browbeaten into issuing an edict that replaced his own revenue officials with the Company's representatives. Over the next several decades, the East India Company, backed by the British government, extended its control over most of India, ruling with a combination of extortion, double-dealing, and outright corruption backed by violence and superior force. This state of affairs continued until 1857, when large numbers of the Company's Indian soldiers spearheaded the first major rebellion against colonial rule. After the rebels were defeated, the British Crown took over power and ruled the country ostensibly more benignly until 1947, when India won independence.  In this explosive book, bestselling author Shashi Tharoor reveals with acuity, impeccable research, and trademark wit, just how disastrous British rule was for India. Besides examining the many ways in which the colonizers exploited India, ranging from the drain of national resources to Britain, the destruction of the Indian textile, steel-making and shipping industries, and the negative transformation of agriculture, he demolishes the arguments of Western and Indian apologists for Empire on the supposed benefits of British rule, including democracy and political freedom, the rule of law, and the railways.   The few unarguable benefits—the English language, tea, and cricket—were never actually intended for the benefit of the colonized but introduced to serve the interests of the colonizers. Brilliantly narrated and passionately argued,   will serve to correct many misconceptions about one of the most contested periods of Indian history.\n",

A public figure since winning his first National Chess Championship at the age of nine, Waitzkin was catapulted into a media whirlwind as a teenager when his father's book \"Searching for Bobby Fischer\" was made into a major motion picture. After dominating the scholastic chess world for ten years, Waitzkin exp Josh Waitzkin knows what it means to be at the top of his game. A public figure since winning his first National Chess Championship at the age of nine, Waitzkin was catapulted into a media whirlwind as a teenager when his father's book \"Searching for Bobby Fischer\" was made into a major motion picture. After dominating the scholastic chess world for ten years, Waitzkin expanded his horizons, taking on the martial art Tai Chi Chuan and ultimately earning the title of World Champion. How was he able to reach the pinnacle of two disciplines that on the surface seem so different? \"I've come to realize that what I am best at is not Tai Chi, and it is not chess,\" he says. \"What I am best at is the art of learning.\"In his riveting new book, \"The Art of Learning,\" Waitzkin tells his remarkable story of personal achievement and shares the principles of learning and performance that have propelled him to the top -- twice. With a narrative that combines heart-stopping martial arts wars and tense chess face-offs with life lessons that speak to all of us, \"The Art of Learning\" takes readers through Waitzkin's unique journey to excellence. He explains in clear detail how a well-thought-out, principled approach to learning is what separates success from failure. Waitzkin believes that achievement, even at the championship level, is a function of a lifestyle that fuels a creative, resilient growth process. Rather than focusing on climactic wins, Waitzkin reveals the inner workings of his everyday method, from systematically triggering intuitive breakthroughs, to honing techniques into states of remarkable potency, to mastering the art of performance psychology. Through his own example, Waitzkin explains how to embrace defeat and make mistakes work for you. Does your opponent make you angry? Waitzkin describes how to channel emotions into creative fuel. As he explains it, obstacles are not obstacles but challenges to overcome, to spur the growth process by turning weaknesses into strengths. He illustrates the exact routines that he has used in all of his competitions, whether mental or physical, so that you too can achieve your peak performance zone in any competitive or professional circumstance. In stories ranging from his early years taking on chess hustlers as a seven year old in New York City's Washington Square Park, to dealing with the pressures of having a film made about his life, to International Chess Championships in India, Hungary, and Brazil, to gripping battles against powerhouse fighters in Taiwan in the Push Hands World Championships, \"The Art of Learning\" encapsulates an extraordinary competitor's life lessons in a page-turning narrative.\n",

Her victim impact statement was posted on BuzzFeed, where it instantly went viral–viewed by eleven million people within four days, it was translated globally and read on the floor of Congress; it inspired changes in California law and the recall of the judge in the case. Thousands wrote to say that she had given them the courage to share their own experiences of assault for the first time. Now she reclaims her identity to tell her story of trauma, transcendence, and the power of words. It was the perfect case, in many ways–there were eyewitnesses, Turner ran away, physical evidence was immediately secured. But her struggles with isolation and shame during the aftermath and the trial reveal the oppression victims face in even the best-case scenarios. Her story illuminates a culture biased to protect perpetrators, indicts a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable, and, ultimately, shines with the courage required to move through suffering and live a full and beautiful life. Know My Name will forever transform the way we think about sexual assault, challenging our beliefs about what is acceptable and speaking truth to the tumultuous reality of healing.

Since Wallerstein first developed world-systems analysis, it has become a widely utilized methodology within the historical social sciences and a common point of reference in discussions of globalization. Now, for the first time in one volume, Wallerstein offers a succinct summary of world-systems analysis and a clear outline of the modern world-system, describing the structures of knowledge upon which it is based, its mechanisms, and its future. Wallerstein explains the defining characteristics of world-systems analysis: its emphasis on world-systems rather than nation-states, on the need to consider historical processes as they unfold over long periods of time, and on combining within a single analytical framework bodies of knowledge usually viewed as distinct from one another—such as history, political science, economics, and sociology. He describes the world-system as a social reality comprised of interconnected nations, firms, households, classes, and identity groups of all kinds. He identifies and highlights the significance of the key moments in the evolution of the modern world-system: the development of a capitalist world-economy in the sixteenth-century, the beginning of two centuries of liberal centrism in the French Revolution of 1789, and the undermining of that centrism in the global revolts of 1968. Intended for general readers, students, and experienced practitioners alike, this book presents a complete overview of world-systems analysis by its original architect.\n",

What Chomsky does to his reader is to demolish and rebuild his ideas about politics, economics and history.

Chomsky shows us the amount of falsification that has been and is always being practiced on these ideas and on history. Chom considers the feeling you will get from reading Noam Chomsky to be anger, tremendous anger, great bitterness. What Chomsky does to his reader is to demolish and rebuild his ideas about politics, economics and history. This demolition sweeps away many ideas that we have always read and thought we had some economic or political knowledge. Chomsky shows us the amount of falsification that has been and is always being practiced on these ideas and on history. Chomsky, now over eighty, is the most quoted living author, his words permeating the writings of thousands around the world. He has written nearly a hundred books, in the fields in which he is active, including linguistics - his main specialty - and politics and philosophy. This collection covers a wide range of topics, from globalization, to American policy toward Iran, to the war in Iraq, to ​​social change, the difference between Obama and Bush, capitalism, the resurgence of the South, one-party politics in America, human nature, language and culture, the future of democracy, religion and politics, Israel and the Holocaust, intellectuals, and the economic crisis. Below I will present some of Chomsky’s views, and the book as a whole is provocative and contrary to the prevailing opinion, its only flaw is the poor and error-filled translation. On globalization, Chomsky says, \"For the record and for the record, I support globalization,\" but he differentiates between the globalization currently proposed, which he sees as a means for the rich to plunder what remains of the poor and consolidate their power over the world. He explains that the globalization he advocates is \"globalization that places the rights of people of flesh and blood at the top of its priorities.\" Regarding American policy toward Iran, Chomsky mentions Kissinger's support for Iran to obtain nuclear energy when it was subject to America during the Shah's era, and the current rejection of the idea, which Kissinger himself justified by saying that the Iranians \"were an allied state\"!! In this book and other books, Chomsky proves repeatedly that America and Israel do not abide by any law that contradicts their interests, even if this law is humane and supported globally, and he scatters examples of this everywhere. The book contains two very important articles for us as Arabs and Muslims, the first about American and Israeli terrorism, and the second about the attack on Fallujah. Chomsky's style in these articles is not only condemnation by mentioning the events, but also comparison with historical actions that were criminalized, to expose the hypocrisy and black face of America and Israel.

      "You are on your way to Ithaca, wishing that the road is long, full of adventures, full of knowledge. Don't be afraid of the Laistrygons and the Cyclops, the angry Poseidon, you will never find such on your way, if your thoughts remain high, if your chosen emotions touch your spirit and body. The Laistrygons and the Cyclops, the fierce Poseidon will not be met. You set out on your way to Ithaca, may the road be long, full of adventures, full of knowledge.

You will not meet the Laistrygons and the Cyclops, the fierce Poseidon, if you do not carry them in your soul, if your soul does not set them before you. Wish the road is long. May there be many summer mornings with which you will be pleased, with what joy you will enter a harbor first seen; to stop at the Phoenician market, and the good things to acquire, pearls and corals, ambers and ebony, and voluptuous spices of all kinds, as much as you can of pleasant herbs; to many Egyptian cities to go, to learn and learn from the learned.

Robert Leckie was 21 when he enlisted in the US Marine Corps in January 1942. In   we follow his journey, from boot camp on Parris Island, South Carolina, all the way to the raging battles in the Pacific, where some of the war's fiercest fighting took place. Recounting his service with the 1st Marine Division and the brutal action on Guadalcanal, New Britain and Peleliu, Leckie spares no detail of the horrors and sacrifice of war, painting an unsentimental portrait of how real warriors are made, fight, and all too often die in the defence of their country. From the live-for-today rowdiness of Marines on leave to the terrors of jungle warfare against an enemy determined to fight to the last man, Leckie describes what it's really like when victory can only be measured inch by bloody inch.

But any community, however smoothly run, suffers tremors when it takes in someone by force. And the arrival of Santa Caterina's new novice sets in motion a chain of events that will shake the convent to its core. Ripped  The year is 1570, and in the convent of Santa Caterina, in the Italian city of Ferrara, noblewomen find space to pursue their lives under God's protection. But any community, however smoothly run, suffers tremors when it takes in someone by force. And the arrival of Santa Caterina's new novice sets in motion a chain of events that will shake the convent to its core. Ripped by her family from an illicit love affair, sixteen-year-old Serafina is willful, emotional, sharp, and defiant, young enough to have a life to look forward to and old enough to know when that life is being cut short. Her first night inside the walls is spent in an incandescent rage so violent that the dispensary mistress, Suora Zuana, is dispatched to the girl's cell to sedate her. Thus begins a complex relationship of trust and betrayal between the young rebel and the clever, scholarly nun, for whom the girl becomes the daughter she will never have. As Serafina rails against her incarceration, others are drawn into the drama: the ancient, mysterious Suora Magdalena, with her history of visions and ecstasies, locked in her cell; the ferociously devout novice mistress Suora Umiliana, who comes to see in the postulant a way to extend her influence; and, watching it all, the abbess, Madonna Chiara, a woman as fluent in politics as she is in prayer. As disorder and rebellion mount, it is the abbess's job to keep the convent stable while, outside its walls, the dictates of the Counter-Reformation begin to purge the Catholic Church and impose on the nunneries a regime of terrible oppression. Sarah Dunant, the bestselling author of  and In the  , brings this intricate Renaissance world compellingly to life.

The town is important because it is a port that serves a large coal mine. Colonel Lanser, the head of the invading battalion, along with his staff establishes his HQ in the house of the democratically elected and popular Mayor Orden. As the reality of occupation sinks in and the weather turns bleak, with the snows beginning earlier than usual, the \"simple, peaceful people\" of the town are angry and confused. Colonel Lanser, a veteran of many wars, tries to operate under a veil of civility and law, but in his heart he knows that \"there are no peaceful people\" amongst those whose freedom has been taken away by force. The veil is soon torn apart when Alexander Morden, an erstwhile alderman and \"a free man,\" is ordered to work in the mine. He strikes out at Captain Loft with a pick axe, but Captain Bentick steps into its path and dies of it. After a summary trial, Morden is executed by a firing squad. This incident catalyzes the people of the town and they settle into \"a slow, silent, waiting revenge.\" Sections of the railroad linking the port with the mine get damaged regularly, the machinery breaks down often, and the dynamo of the electricity generators gets short circuited. Whenever a soldier relaxes his guard, drinks or goes out with a woman, he is killed. Mayor Orden stands by his people, and tries to explain to Col. Lanser that his goal – \"to break man's spirit permanently\" – is impossible. The cold weather and the constant fear weighs heavy on the occupying force, many of whom wish the war to end so that they can return home. They realize the futility of the war and that \"the flies have conquered the flypaper.\" Some members of the resistance escape to England and ask the English for explosives so that the townspeople can intensify their efforts.

Mayor Orden knows that nothing can stop his people and that his death is imminent. He tells his wife that while he can be killed, the idea of Mayor (and freedom and democracy) is beyond the reach of any army. Before his execution, Mayor Orden reminds Dr. Winter of the dialogues of Socrates in the Apology, a part he played in the high school play, and tells him to make sure that the debt is repaid to the army, i.e., that the resistance is continued.\n",

She wants the journal to go to her fiancé, who has enrolled with the Free French Forces, as she knows she may not live much longer. She was right.

An inquisitive seven-year-old, Martin Booth found himself with the whole of Hong Kong at his feet when his father was posted there in the early 1950s. Unrestricted by parental control and blessed with bright blond hair that signified good luck to the Chinese, he had free access to hidden corners of the colony normally closed to a Gweilo, a 'pale fellow' like him. Befriending rickshaw coolies and local stallholders, he learnt Cantonese, sampled delicacies such as boiled water beetles and one-hundred-year-old eggs, and participated in colourful festivals. He even entered the forbidden Kowloon Walled City, wandered into the secret lair of the Triads and visited an opium den. Along the way he encountered a colourful array of people, from the plink plonk man with his dancing monkey to Nagasaki Jim, a drunken child molester, and the Queen of Kowloon, the crazed tramp who may have been a member of the Romanov family. Shadowed by the unhappiness of his warring parents, a broad-minded mother who, like her son, was keen to embrace all things Chinese, and a bigoted father who was enraged by his family's interest in 'going native', Martin Booth's compelling memoir is a journey into Chinese culture and an extinct colonial way of life that glows with infectious curiosity and humour.\n",

The black wolf, who still didn't think that this important group of clans and clans had come to do such a thing, was very upset when he heard the words of the senior dog, but relying on the precious experiences of the past, he controlled his jittery nerves and strongly Confused, he left his room for a moment under the pretext of needing to go to bed, and by repeatedly vomiting, he partially neutralized the severe nausea he had experienced. The black wolf had never shown such sensitivity to any of his previous wives. All those who had close contact with the black wolf knew very well that the story of the horse girl was different from all the previous stories. The black wolf, who had always brought to his knees and restrained the most difficult problems and the most complex issues, seemed very strange to suffer such turmoil and mental turmoil in this special and not so important case. He wished that instead of a drunken dog, another animal wanted the girl's horse, and instead of a group of dogs, another group would come to him to talk about it, so that he would know how to give them their right. But the problem was that the dog clan was one of the most influential clans in the forest society, and it was not easy to make them dissatisfied with themselves and pessimistic about their leadership just by wanting or not wanting a female horse. If he had known about the incident just an hour earlier, he would have preempted the group of dogs with a trick and with a calculated plan prevented them from being in his house and without their knowledge and in one stroke, he would have married the girl's horse permanently. He took care of himself and prevented the issue from getting complicated.\n",

As with a palimpsest, behind the sentences another script appears; behind the conciseness and honesty of the Enlightenment lie the humor and sadness of Romanticism. From childhood, John Franklin has dreamed of going to sea, even though he is completely unsuited to it: slow in speech and thought, slow in his reactions, he measures time by his own standards. At first, only his teacher recognizes that John's strange disability also has advantages - once he has grasped something, he retains it, he understands the unique and the details better than others. John Franklin joins the navy, experiences war and death. Both of these things hit him all the harder because he sees individual events unfolding in slow motion within the chaotic, fast-paced events that he barely understands. He dreams of peaceful discovery, wants to find the legendary Northwest Passage.\n",

The book deals with social topics and others about description and love, as well as topics that clarify the ambiguous facts of Islam, its ethics, and its backgrounds, and some of the aesthetics of the Qur’an, extracting its facts from the world and sending them within texts formulated in the form of a story that tends to draw the reader's attention to the meaning.\n",

Deslumbrante de principio a fin, El pintor de batallas arrastra al lector, subyugado, a través de la compleja geometría del caos del siglo XXI: el arte, la ciencia, la guerra, el amor, la lucidez y la soledad, se combinan en el vasto mural de un mundo que agoniza\n",

Desperate to see action but rejected by both the marines and paratroopers because he was too short, Murphy eventually found a home with the infantry.

      "One is a married, no-nonsense Los Angeles police detective. The other is Hollywood's new darling, the one whose photos the tabloids are fighting over. If it weren't for the murder of a young prostitute in one of LA's wealthiest neighborhoods, they would never have met... As two opposing worlds collide in a game of hide-and-seek mixed with fascination and pretense, the police investigation will reveal much more than the identity of the culprit. Behind the cliché of a well-ordered existence, or that of glitter and glamour, hide the vulnerability and solitude of two beings. Neither had anticipated the violent attraction that suddenly pushes them towards each other. How will these two men, icons of a certain America and symbols of virility, face the unprecedented? And how long can a love, even absolute, remain on the fringes of morality and law? Part crime novel, part road movie, this homage to Hollywood films is also the story of a mythical city, Los Angeles, where the omnipresent Californian light radiates everything, from the streets to the villas of stars, through the motels of Venice Beach and the shores of the Pacific. This vengeful light seems to have only one goal: to reveal the lies of appearances, to confront beings with their buried secrets and their naked truth.\n",
